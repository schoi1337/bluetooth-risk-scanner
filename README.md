# Bluetooth Risk Scanner üõ°Ô∏èüîç

>[!Note]
>This is currently under development

Bluetooth Risk Scanner is a lightweight tool designed to scan nearby Bluetooth devices and identify potential privacy and security risks associated with them.

It doesn't just list devices ‚Äî it checks if they belong to vendors known for privacy issues, previous data breaches, or are associated with recent Bluetooth vulnerabilities (CVEs).

## üöÄ Features

- Scan nearby Bluetooth (BLE) devices
- Normalize MAC prefixes and map to vendors using Wireshark's manuf database
- Detect vendors with known privacy concerns
- Highlight devices linked to past security incidents
- Cross-reference devices against recent Bluetooth CVEs
- Display results in terminal and save as JSON
- Generate results as a visual HTML report

### üìä Comparison with Other Tools

| Tool | Main Features | Bluetooth Risk Scanner |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Btlejuice** | BLE Man-in-the-Middle attack framework | Focuses on **risk detection**, not active attacks. |
| **BLE Scanner App** | iOS/Android BLE device discovery | Focuses on **security/privacy risk analysis**, not just listing devices. |
| **gatttool (deprecated)** | CLI tool for basic BLE scanning | Offers **risk evaluation, CVE matching, and reporting** on top of scanning. |
| **Nmap Bluetooth Scripts** | Limited Bluetooth scanning scripts | Specializes in **BLE-centric risk analysis and CVE tracking**. |
| **Armis** | Enterprise IoT and BLE device risk management | Provides a **lightweight, free BLE risk detection tool** instead of expensive enterprise SaaS solutions. |
| **Asimily** | BLE/IoT risk detection for healthcare and industrial environments |  **Focuses specifically on BLE device privacy and vulnerabilities**, and does not target general security of IoT environments. |
| **Ordr** | IoT and medical device visibility and risk management |  **Specializes in targeted BLE device risk scanning**, not for full asset management |
| **Nozomi Networks** | Industrial control system (ICS) cybersecurity | **Analyze BLE risks in real-world physical spaces**, does not focus on industrial networks. |
| **Forescout** | Device detection and risk management across networks and IoT | Provide a **simple, deployable BLE risk analysis tool**, not designed for large enterprise network environments. |

## üéØ Bluetooth Risk Scanner is designed for:

- **Security Researchers**  
  Quickly identify BLE device vulnerabilities and privacy risks during security assessments.
- **Penetration Testers**  
  Add BLE risk detection to physical and wireless security engagements.
- **Red Team Operators**  
  Map nearby BLE device exposures without intrusive scans.
- **IoT/OT Security Analysts**  
  Assess the risk posture of Bluetooth-enabled assets.
- **Privacy Advocates**  
  Detect and highlight BLE devices from vendors known for privacy issues.
- **Cybersecurity Students and Enthusiasts**  
  Learn BLE device security analysis with an easy-to-use open-source tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schoi1337/bluetooth-risk-scanner.git
cd bluetooth-risk-scanner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> Note: This tool requires a Bluetooth adapter and Python 3.8+.

## üìã Usage

```bash
python main.py --all
```

The results will be displayed in the terminal and saved to `output/scan_results.json`.

## üìà Generating a Scan Report (HTML)

After scanning, you can generate a visual HTML report:

![BLE Risk Report Preview](/screenshots/Report.png)

```bash
python main.py --report
```

The report will be automatically opened in your browser after generation.  
It is also saved as `report.html` in the project root.

## üß† How it Works

- Performs a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) scan.
- Parses MAC addresses and maps to vendor using Wireshark's manuf database
- Calculates a risk score based on known CVEs, signal strength, and vendor reputation
- Saves results to JSON and generates HTML report with color-coded risk indicators

## üîÄ Alternative Branches

This project also includes a dedicated branch for Ubertooth users:

### [`feature/ubertooth-support`](https://github.com/schoi1337/bluetooth-risk-scanner/tree/feature/ubertooth-support)

> Passive BLE scanning using `ubertooth-btle -n` (no HCI Bluetooth dongle required)

- Parses BLE advertisement packets in real-time
- Performs risk assessment based on MAC prefixes and local name keywords
- Maps MAC address prefixes to vendor names using IEEE OUI database
- Generates a color-coded HTML risk report

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

- [x] HTML + JSON reporting implemented
- [x] Improve MAC address to vendor matching accuracy (expand OUI database using manuf)
- [ ] Integrate CVE database lookup (NVD API integration)
- [ ] Add more privacy risk indicators based on BLE advertisement data
- [ ] Introduce scoring weight configuration for flexible risk assessment
- [ ] Optimize BLE device scanning performance
- [x] Implement HTML report generation alongside JSON output
- [x] Add CLI options for advanced scanning parameters (e.g., custom timeout, filter)
- [ ] Prepare full documentation with examples and API references
