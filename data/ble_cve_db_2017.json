The attack can originate both from NORTH or SOUTH. The above description is for a north bound attack. A south bound attack can originate when an attacker attempts a flow flooding attack and since flows come with timeouts, the attack is not successful. However, the attacker will now be successful in CONTROLLER overflow attack (resource consumption). Although, the network (actual flow tables) and operational DS are only (~)1% occupied, the controller requests for resource consumption.

The vulnerability exists due to changes in the implementation of the BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN RFC (RFC 7432) draft between IOS XE software releases. When the BGP Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route or BGP EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement Route update packet is received, it could be possible that the IP address length field is miscalculated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP packet to an affected device after the BGP session was established. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload or corrupt the BGP routing table; either outcome would result in a DoS. The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a crafted BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. This vulnerability affects all releases of Cisco IOS XE Software prior to software release 16.3 that support BGP EVPN configurations. If the device is not configured for EVPN, it is not vulnerable.

This HTTP API receives the credentials as base64 encoded in the Authorization HTTP header. However, a missing length check in the code allows an attacker to send a string of 1024 characters in the password field, and allows an attacker to exploit a memory corruption issue. This can allow an attacker to circumvent the account protection mechanism and brute force the credentials. If the firmware version Amcrest_IPC-AWXX_Eng_N_V2.420.AC00.17.R.20170322 is dissected using the binwalk tool, one obtains a _user-x.squashfs.img.extracted archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that has many of the binaries in the /usr folder. The binary \"sonia\" is the one that has the vulnerable function that performs the credential check in the binary for the HTTP API specification. If we open this binary in IDA Pro we will notice that this follows an ARM little-endian format. The function at address 00415364 in IDA Pro starts the HTTP authentication process. This function calls another function at sub_ 0042CCA0 at address 0041549C.

    "description": "Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol implementations may improperly determine Link State Advertisement (LSA) recency for LSAs with MaxSequenceNumber. According to RFC 2328 section 13.1, for two instances of the same LSA, recency is determined by first comparing sequence numbers, then checksums, and finally MaxAge. In a case where the sequence numbers are the same, the LSA with the larger checksum is considered more recent, and will not be flushed from the Link State Database (LSDB). Since the RFC does not explicitly state that the values of links carried by a LSA must be the same when prematurely aging a self-originating LSA with MaxSequenceNumber, it is possible in vulnerable OSPF implementations for an attacker to craft a LSA with MaxSequenceNumber and invalid links that will result in a larger checksum and thus a 'newer' LSA that will not be flushed from the LSDB. Propagation of the crafted LSA can result in the erasure or alteration of the routing tables of routers within the routing domain, creating a denial of service condition or the re-routing of traffic on the network. CVE-2017-3224 has been reserved for Quagga and downstream implementations (SUSE, openSUSE, and Red Hat packages).",

The vulnerability occurs because a certain system log file does not have a maximum size restriction. Therefore, the file is allowed to consume the majority of available disk space on the appliance. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted remote connection requests to the appliance. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to increase the size of a system log file so that it consumes most of the disk space. The lack of available disk space could lead to a DoS condition in which the application functions could operate abnormally, making the appliance unstable. This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Voice Operating System (VOS)-based products: Emergency Responder, Finesse, Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment, MediaSense, Prime License Manager, SocialMiner, Unified Communications Manager (UCM), Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service (IM&P - earlier releases were known as Cisco Unified Presence), Unified Communication Manager Session Management Edition (SME), Unified Contact Center Express (UCCx), Unified Intelligence Center (UIC), Unity Connection, Virtualized Voice Browser.

Amcrest cloud services does not perform a thorough verification when allowing the user to add a new camera to the user's account to ensure that the user actually owns the camera other than knowing the serial number of the camera. This can allow an attacker who knows the serial number to easily add another user's camera to an attacker's cloud account and control it completely. This is possible in case of any camera that is currently not a part of an Amcrest cloud account or has been removed from the user's cloud account. Also, another requirement for a successful attack is that the user should have rebooted the camera in the last two hours. However, both of these conditions are very likely for new cameras that are sold over the Internet at many ecommerce websites or vendors that sell the Amcrest products. The successful attack results in an attacker being able to completely control the camera which includes being able to view and listen on what the camera can see, being able to change the motion detection settings and also be able to turn the camera off without the user being aware of it. Note: The same attack can be executed using the Amcrest Cloud mobile application.",

This daemon handles custom D-Link UDP based protocol that allows D-Link mobile applications and desktop applications to discover D-Link devices on the local network. The binary processes the received UDP packets sent from any device in \"main\" function. One path in the function traverses towards a block of code that handles commands to be executed on the device.

If a packet is received with the packet type being \"S\" or 0x53 then the string passed in the \"C\" parameter is base64 decoded and then executed by passing into a System API. We can see at address 0x00009B44 that the string received in packet type subtracts 0x31 or \"1\" from the packet type and is compared against 0x22 or \"double quotes\". If that is the case, then the packet is sent towards the block of code that executes a command. Then the value stored in \"C\" parameter is extracted at address 0x0000A1B0. Finally, the string received is base 64 decoded and passed on to the system API at address 0x0000A2A8 as shown below. The same form of communication can be initiated by any process including an attacker process on the mobile phone or the desktop and this allows a third-party application on the device to execute commands on the device without any authentication by sending just 1 UDP packet with custom base64 encoding.",

This is correct if the input is in the right range; if it isn't, the buffer may be overrun (depending on the sizes of the types on the current platform). Of course the inputs ought to be right. And there are pointers in there too, so perhaps one could say that the caller ought to check these things. It may be better to require the caller to make the pointer structure right, but to have the code here be defensive about (and tolerate with an error but without crashing) out-of-range integer values. So: it should defend each of these integer conversion sites with a check for the actual permitted range, and return adns_s_invaliddata if not. The lack of this check causes the SOA sign extension bug to be a serious security problem: the sign extended SOA value is out of range, and overruns the buffer when reconverted. This is related to sign extending SOA 32-bit integer fields, and use of a signed data type.",
