In versions starting at 2.6 and prior to 7.4.3, An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers, until the server runs out of memory or is killed. By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from \"NOAUTH\" responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways. Either using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc, or enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/fpu: Ensure shadow stack is active before \"getting\" registers\n\nThe x86 shadow stack support has its own set of registers. Those registers\nare XSAVE-managed, but they are \"supervisor state components\" which means\nthat userspace can not touch them with XSAVE/XRSTOR.  It also means that\nthey are not accessible from the existing ptrace ABI for XSAVE state.\nThus, there is a new ptrace get/set interface for it.\n\nThe regset code that ptrace uses provides an ->active() handler in\naddition to the get/set ones. For shadow stack this ->active() handler\nverifies that shadow stack is enabled via the ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK bit in the\nthread struct. The ->active() handler is checked from some call sites of\nthe regset get/set handlers, but not the ptrace ones. This was not\nunderstood when shadow stack support was put in place.\n\nAs a result, both the set/get handlers can be called with\nXFEATURE_CET_USER in its init state, which would cause get_xsave_addr() to\nreturn NULL and trigger a WARN_ON(). The ssp_set() handler luckily has an\nssp_active() check to avoid surprising the kernel with shadow stack\nbehavior when the kernel is not ready for it (ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK==0). That\ncheck just happened to avoid the warning.\n\nBut the ->get() side wasn't so lucky. It can be called with shadow stacks\ndisabled, triggering the warning in practice, as reported by Christina\nSchimpe:\n\nWARNING: CPU: 5 PID: 1773 at arch/x86/kernel/fpu/regset.c:198 ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n[...]\nCall Trace:\n<TASK>\n? show_regs+0x6e/0x80\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? __warn+0x91/0x150\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? report_bug+0x19d/0x1b0\n? handle_bug+0x46/0x80\n? exc_invalid_op+0x1d/0x80\n? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x1f/0x30\n? __pfx_ssp_get+0x10/0x10\n? ssp_get+0x89/0xa0\n? ssp_get+0x52/0xa0\n__regset_get+0xad/0xf0\ncopy_regset_to_user+0x52/0xc0\nptrace_regset+0x119/0x140\nptrace_request+0x13c/0x850\n? wait_task_inactive+0x142/0x1d0\n? do_syscall_64+0x6d/0x90\narch_ptrace+0x102/0x300\n[...]\n\nEnsure that shadow stacks are active in a thread before looking them up\nin the XSAVE buffer. Since ARCH_SHSTK_SHSTK and user_ssp[SHSTK_EN] are\nset at the same time, the active check ensures that there will be\nsomething to find in the XSAVE buffer.\n\n[ dhansen: changelog/subject tweaks ]",

To avoid deadlock. the commit 76bb5ab8f6e3 (\"cpuset: break\nkernfs active protection in cpuset_write_resmask()\") added\n'kernfs_break_active_protection' in the cpuset_write_resmask. This could\nlead to this warning.\n\nAfter the commit 2125c0034c5d (\"cgroup/cpuset: Make cpuset hotplug\nprocessing synchronous\"), the cpuset_write_resmask no longer needs to\nwait the hotplug to finish, which means that concurrent hotplug and cpuset\noperations are no longer possible. Therefore, the deadlock doesn't exist\nanymore and it does not have to 'break active protection' now. To fix this\nwarning, just remove kernfs_break_active_protection operation in the\n'cpuset_write_resmask'.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnetfs: Fix kernel async DIO\n\nNetfslib needs to be able to handle kernel-initiated asynchronous DIO that\nis supplied with a bio_vec[] array.  Currently, because of the async flag,\nthis gets passed to netfs_extract_user_iter() which throws a warning and\nfails because it only handles IOVEC and UBUF iterators.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts\n\nEven though we fixed a logic error in the commit cited below, syzbot\nstill managed to trigger an underflow of the per-host bulk flow\ncounters, leading to an out of bounds memory access.\n\nTo avoid any such logic errors causing out of bounds memory accesses,\nthis commit factors out all accesses to the per-host bulk flow counters\nto a series of helpers that perform bounds-checking before any\nincrements and decrements. This also has the benefit of improving\nreadability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into\nthese helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the\ncode (which was the cause of the original logic error).\n\nAs part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated\ninto a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the\nost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a\nsparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect\nof this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow\nstays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases. This should\nnot make a noticeable difference in practice, and thus it's not worth\ncomplicating the code to preserve the old behaviour.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndm thin: make get_first_thin use rcu-safe list first function\n\nThe documentation in rculist.h explains the absence of list_empty_rcu()\nand cautions programmers against relying on a list_empty() ->\nlist_first() sequence in RCU safe code.  This is because each of these\nfunctions performs its own READ_ONCE() of the list head.  This can lead\nto a situation where the list_empty() sees a valid list entry, but the\nsubsequent list_first() sees a different view of list head state after a\nmodification.\n\nIn the case of dm-thin, this author had a production box crash from a GP\nfault in the process_deferred_bios path.  This function saw a valid list\nhead in get_first_thin() but when it subsequently dereferenced that and\nturned it into a thin_c, it got the inside of the struct pool, since the\nlist was now empty and referring to itself.  The kernel on which this\noccurred printed both a warning about a refcount_t being saturated, and\na UBSAN error for an out-of-bounds cpuid access in the queued spinlock,\nprior to the fault itself.  When the resulting kdump was examined, it\nwas possible to see another thread patiently waiting in thin_dtr's\nsynchronize_rcu.\n\nThe thin_dtr call managed to pull the thin_c out of the active thins\nlist (and have it be the last entry in the active_thins list) at just\nthe wrong moment which lead to this crash.\n\nFortunately, the fix here is straight forward.  Switch get_first_thin()\nfunction to use list_first_or_null_rcu() which performs just a single\nREAD_ONCE() and returns NULL if the list is already empty.\n\nThis was run against the devicemapper test suite's thin-provisioning\nsuites for delete and suspend and no regressions were observed.",

As soon as the fence is\nsignaled in the IRQ execution thread, a new job starts to be executed.\nThis results in a race condition where the IRQ execution thread sets the\njob pointer to NULL simultaneously as the `run_job()` function assigns\na new job to the pointer.\n\nThis race condition can lead to a NULL pointer dereference if the IRQ\nexecution thread sets the job pointer to NULL after `run_job()` assigns\nit to the new job. When the new job completes and the GPU emits an\ninterrupt, `v3d_irq()` is triggered, potentially causing a crash.\n\n[  466.310099] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000000000c0\n[  466.318928] Mem abort info:\n[  466.321723]   ESR = 0x0000000096000005\n[  466.325479]   EC = 0x25: DABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits\n[  466.330807]   SET = 0, FnV = 0\n[  466.333864]   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0\n[  466.337010]   FSC = 0x05: level 1 translation fault\n[  466.341900] Data abort info:\n[  466.344783]   ISV = 0, ISS = 0x00000005, ISS2 = 0x00000000\n[  466.350285]   CM = 0, WnR = 0, TnD = 0, TagAccess = 0\n[  466.355350]   GCS = 0, Overlay = 0, DirtyBit = 0, Xs = 0\n[  466.360677] user pgtable: 4k pages, 39-bit VAs, pgdp=0000000089772000\n[  466.367140] [00000000000000c0] pgd=0000000000000000, p4d=0000000000000000, pud=0000000000000000\n[  466.375875] Internal error: Oops: 0000000096000005 [#1] PREEMPT SMP\n[  466.382163] Modules linked in: rfcomm snd_seq_dummy snd_hrtimer snd_seq snd_seq_device algif_hash algif_skcipher af_alg bnep binfmt_misc vc4 snd_soc_hdmi_codec drm_display_helper cec brcmfmac_wcc spidev rpivid_hevc(C) drm_client_lib brcmfmac hci_uart drm_dma_helper pisp_be btbcm brcmutil snd_soc_core aes_ce_blk v4l2_mem2mem bluetooth aes_ce_cipher snd_compress videobuf2_dma_contig ghash_ce cfg80211 gf128mul snd_pcm_dmaengine videobuf2_memops ecdh_generic sha2_ce ecc videobuf2_v4l2 snd_pcm v3d sha256_arm64 rfkill videodev snd_timer sha1_ce libaes gpu_sched snd videobuf2_common sha1_generic drm_shmem_helper mc rp1_pio drm_kms_helper raspberrypi_hwmon spi_bcm2835 gpio_keys i2c_brcmstb rp1 raspberrypi_gpiomem rp1_mailbox rp1_adc nvmem_rmem uio_pdrv_genirq uio i2c_dev drm ledtrig_pattern drm_panel_orientation_quirks backlight fuse dm_mod ip_tables x_tables ipv6\n[  466.458429] CPU: 0 UID: 1000 PID: 2008 Comm: chromium Tainted: G         C         6.13.0-v8+ #18\n[  466.467336] Tainted: [C]=CRAP\n[  466.470306] Hardware name: Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.0 (DT)\n[  466.476157] pstate: 404000c9 (nZcv daIF +PAN -UAO -TCO -DIT -SSBS BTYPE=--)\n[  466.483143] pc : v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d]\n[  466.487258] lr : __handle_irq_event_percpu+0x60/0x228\n[  466.492327] sp : ffffffc080003ea0\n[  466.495646] x29: ffffffc080003ea0 x28: ffffff80c0c94200 x27: 0000000000000000\n[  466.502807] x26: ffffffd08dd81d7b x25: ffffff80c0c94200 x24: ffffff8003bdc200\n[  466.509969] x23: 0000000000000001 x22: 00000000000000a7 x21: 0000000000000000\n[  466.517130] x20: ffffff8041bb0000 x19: 0000000000000001 x18: 0000000000000000\n[  466.524291] x17: ffffffafadfb0000 x16: ffffffc080000000 x15: 0000000000000000\n[  466.531452] x14: 0000000000000000 x13: 0000000000000000 x12: 0000000000000000\n[  466.538613] x11: 0000000000000000 x10: 0000000000000000 x9 : ffffffd08c527eb0\n[  466.545777] x8 : 0000000000000000 x7 : 0000000000000000 x6 : 0000000000000000\n[  466.552941] x5 : ffffffd08c4100d0 x4 : ffffffafadfb0000 x3 : ffffffc080003f70\n[  466.560102] x2 : ffffffc0829e8058 x1 : 0000000000000001 x0 : 0000000000000000\n[  466.567263] Call trace:\n[  466.569711]  v3d_irq+0x118/0x2e0 [v3d] (P)\n[  466.\n---truncated---",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: zswap: properly synchronize freeing resources during CPU hotunplug\n\nIn zswap_compress() and zswap_decompress(), the per-CPU acomp_ctx of the\ncurrent CPU at the beginning of the operation is retrieved and used\nthroughout.  However, since neither preemption nor migration are disabled,\nit is possible that the operation continues on a different CPU.\n\nIf the original CPU is hotunplugged while the acomp_ctx is still in use,\nwe run into a UAF bug as some of the resources attached to the acomp_ctx\nare freed during hotunplug in zswap_cpu_comp_dead() (i.e. \nacomp_ctx.buffer, acomp_ctx.req, or acomp_ctx.acomp).\n\nThe problem was introduced in commit 1ec3b5fe6eec (\"mm/zswap: move to use\ncrypto_acomp API for hardware acceleration\") when the switch to the\ncrypto_acomp API was made.  Prior to that, the per-CPU crypto_comp was\nretrieved using get_cpu_ptr() which disables preemption and makes sure the\nCPU cannot go away from under us.  Preemption cannot be disabled with the\ncrypto_acomp API as a sleepable context is needed.\n\nUse the acomp_ctx.mutex to synchronize CPU hotplug callbacks allocating\nand freeing resources with compression/decompression paths.  Make sure\nthat acomp_ctx.req is NULL when the resources are freed.  In the\ncompression/decompression paths, check if acomp_ctx.req is NULL after\nacquiring the mutex (meaning the CPU was offlined) and retry on the new\nCPU.\n\nThe initialization of acomp_ctx.mutex is moved from the CPU hotplug\ncallback to the pool initialization where it belongs (where the mutex is\nallocated).  In addition to adding clarity, this makes sure that CPU\nhotplug cannot reinitialize a mutex that is already locked by\ncompression/decompression.\n\nPreviously a fix was attempted by holding cpus_read_lock() [1].  This\nwould have caused a potential deadlock as it is possible for code already\nholding the lock to fall into reclaim and enter zswap (causing a\ndeadlock).  A fix was also attempted using SRCU for synchronization, but\nJohannes pointed out that synchronize_srcu() cannot be used in CPU hotplug\nnotifiers [2].\n\nAlternative fixes that were considered/attempted and could have worked:\n- Refcounting the per-CPU acomp_ctx. This involves complexity in\n  handling the race between the refcount dropping to zero in\n  zswap_[de]compress() and the refcount being re-initialized when the\n  CPU is onlined.\n- Disabling migration before getting the per-CPU acomp_ctx [3], but\n  that's discouraged and is a much bigger hammer than needed, and could\n  result in subtle performance issues.\n\n[1]https://lkml.kernel.org/20241219212437.2714151-1-yosryahmed@google.com/\n[2]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107074724.1756696-2-yosryahmed@google.com/\n[3]https://lkml.kernel.org/20250107222236.2715883-2-yosryahmed@google.com/\n\n[yosryahmed@google.com: remove comment]",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nkernel: be more careful about dup_mmap() failures and uprobe registering\n\nIf a memory allocation fails during dup_mmap(), the maple tree can be left\nin an unsafe state for other iterators besides the exit path.  All the\nlocks are dropped before the exit_mmap() call (in mm/mmap.c), but the\nincomplete mm_struct can be reached through (at least) the rmap finding\nthe vmas which have a pointer back to the mm_struct.\n\nUp to this point, there have been no issues with being able to find an\nmm_struct that was only partially initialised.  Syzbot was able to make\nthe incomplete mm_struct fail with recent forking changes, so it has been\nproven unsafe to use the mm_struct that hasn't been initialised, as\nreferenced in the link below.\n\nAlthough 8ac662f5da19f (\"fork: avoid inappropriate uprobe access to\ninvalid mm\") fixed the uprobe access, it does not completely remove the\nrace.\n\nThis patch sets the MMF_OOM_SKIP to avoid the iteration of the vmas on the\noom side (even though this is extremely unlikely to be selected as an oom\nvictim in the race window), and sets MMF_UNSTABLE to avoid other potential\nusers from using a partially initialised mm_struct.\n\nWhen registering vmas for uprobe, skip the vmas in an mm that is marked\nunstable.  Modifying a vma in an unstable mm may cause issues if the mm\nisn't fully initialised.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntcp: correct handling of extreme memory squeeze\n\nTesting with iperf3 using the \"pasta\" protocol splicer has revealed\na problem in the way tcp handles window advertising in extreme memory\nsqueeze situations.\n\nUnder memory pressure, a socket endpoint may temporarily advertise\na zero-sized window, but this is not stored as part of the socket data.\nThe reasoning behind this is that it is considered a temporary setting\nwhich shouldn't influence any further calculations.\n\nHowever, if we happen to stall at an unfortunate value of the current\nwindow size, the algorithm selecting a new value will consistently fail\nto advertise a non-zero window once we have freed up enough memory.\nThis means that this side's notion of the current window size is\ndifferent from the one last advertised to the peer, causing the latter\nto not send any data to resolve the sitution.\n\nThe problem occurs on the iperf3 server side, and the socket in question\nis a completely regular socket with the default settings for the\nfedora40 kernel.

And if an error is returned, it\ntriggers the legacy BUG_ON() checks in each routine.\n\nThis assumption is wrong, as proven by syzbot: the buffer layer called by\nnilfs_prepare_chunk() may call nilfs_get_block() if necessary, which may\nfail due to metadata corruption or other reasons.  This has been there all\nalong, but improved sanity checks and error handling may have made it more\nreproducible in fuzzing tests.\n\nFix this issue by adding missing error paths in nilfs_set_link(),\nnilfs_delete_entry(), and their caller nilfs_rename().",

We can't overcome this\nproblem. This might lead to bad steering state (e.g. wrong connection\nbetween matchers), and will also lead to resource leakage, as it is\nthe case with any other error handling during resource destruction.\n\nHowever, the goal here is to allow the driver to continue and not crash\nthe machine with use-after-free error.",

This led to the attached lockdep complaint.\n\nFix this by changing spinlocks of rxnet->peer_hash_lock back to\nBH-disabling locks.\n\n    ================================\n    WARNING: inconsistent lock state\n    6.13.0-rc5-build2+ #1223 Tainted: G            E\n    --------------------------------\n    inconsistent {SOFTIRQ-ON-W} -> {IN-SOFTIRQ-W} usage.\n    swapper/1/0 [HC0[0]:SC1[1]:HE1:SE0] takes:\n    ffff88810babe228 (&rxnet->peer_hash_lock){+.?.}-{3:3}, at: rxrpc_put_peer+0xcb/0x180\n    {SOFTIRQ-ON-W} state was registered at:\n      mark_usage+0x164/0x180\n      __lock_acquire+0x544/0x990\n      lock_acquire.part.0+0x103/0x280\n      _raw_spin_lock+0x2f/0x40\n      rxrpc_peer_keepalive_worker+0x144/0x440\n      process_one_work+0x486/0x7c0\n      process_scheduled_works+0x73/0x90\n      worker_thread+0x1c8/0x2a0\n      kthread+0x19b/0x1b0\n      ret_from_fork+0x24/0x40\n      ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n    irq event stamp: 972402\n    hardirqs last  enabled at (972402): [<ffffffff8244360e>] _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x2e/0x50\n    hardirqs last disabled at (972401): [<ffffffff82443328>] _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x18/0x60\n    softirqs last  enabled at (972300): [<ffffffff810ffbbe>] handle_softirqs+0x3ee/0x430\n    softirqs last disabled at (972313): [<ffffffff810ffc54>] __irq_exit_rcu+0x44/0x110\n\n    other info that might help us debug this:\n     Possible unsafe locking scenario:\n           CPU0\n           ----\n      lock(&rxnet->peer_hash_lock);\n      <Interrupt>\n        lock(&rxnet->peer_hash_lock);\n\n     *** DEADLOCK ***\n    1 lock held by swapper/1/0:\n     #0: ffffffff83576be0 (rcu_callback){....}-{0:0}, at: rcu_lock_acquire+0x7/0x30\n\n    stack backtrace:\n    CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Tainted: G            E      6.13.0-rc5-build2+ #1223\n    Tainted: [E]=UNSIGNED_MODULE\n    Hardware name: ASUS All Series/H97-PLUS, BIOS 2306 10/09/2014\n    Call Trace:\n     <IRQ>\n     dump_stack_lvl+0x57/0x80\n     print_usage_bug.part.0+0x227/0x240\n     valid_state+0x53/0x70\n     mark_lock_irq+0xa5/0x2f0\n     mark_lock+0xf7/0x170\n     mark_usage+0xe1/0x180\n     __lock_acquire+0x544/0x990\n     lock_acquire.part.0+0x103/0x280\n     _raw_spin_lock+0x2f/0x40\n     rxrpc_put_peer+0xcb/0x180\n     afs_free_addrlist+0x46/0x90 [kafs]\n     rcu_do_batch+0x2d2/0x640\n     rcu_core+0x2f7/0x350\n     handle_softirqs+0x1ee/0x430\n     __irq_exit_rcu+0x44/0x110\n     irq_exit_rcu+0xa/0x30\n     sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0x7f/0xa0\n     </IRQ>",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbatman-adv: Drop unmanaged ELP metric worker\n\nThe ELP worker needs to calculate new metric values for all neighbors\n\"reachable\" over an interface. Some of the used metric sources require\nlocks which might need to sleep. This sleep is incompatible with the RCU\nlist iterator used for the recorded neighbors. The initial approach to work\naround of this problem was to queue another work item per neighbor and then\nrun this in a new context.\n\nEven when this solved the RCU vs might_sleep() conflict, it has a major\nproblems: Nothing was stopping the work item in case it is not needed\nanymore - for example because one of the related interfaces was removed or\nthe batman-adv module was unloaded - resulting in potential invalid memory\naccesses.\n\nDirectly canceling the metric worker also has various problems:\n\n* cancel_work_sync for a to-be-deactivated interface is called with\n  rtnl_lock held. But the code in the ELP metric worker also tries to use\n  rtnl_lock() - which will never return in this case. This also means that\n  cancel_work_sync would never return because it is waiting for the worker\n  to finish.\n* iterating over the neighbor list for the to-be-deactivated interface is\n  currently done using the RCU specific methods. Which means that it is\n  possible to miss items when iterating over it without the associated\n  spinlock - a behaviour which is acceptable for a periodic metric check\n  but not for a cleanup routine (which must \"stop\" all still running\n  workers)\n\nThe better approch is to get rid of the per interface neighbor metric\nworker and handle everything in the interface worker. The original problems\nare solved by:\n\n* creating a list of neighbors which require new metric information inside\n  the RCU protected context, gathering the metric according to the new list\n  outside the RCU protected context\n* only use rcu_trylock inside metric gathering code to avoid a deadlock\n  when the cancel_delayed_work_sync is called in the interface removal code\n  (which is called with the rtnl_lock held)",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Cancel the running bpf_timer through kworker for PREEMPT_RT\n\nDuring the update procedure, when overwrite element in a pre-allocated\nhtab, the freeing of old_element is protected by the bucket lock. The\nreason why the bucket lock is necessary is that the old_element has\nalready been stashed in htab->extra_elems after alloc_htab_elem()\nreturns. If freeing the old_element after the bucket lock is unlocked,\nthe stashed element may be reused by concurrent update procedure and the\nfreeing of old_element will run concurrently with the reuse of the\nold_element. However, the invocation of check_and_free_fields() may\nacquire a spin-lock which violates the lockdep rule because its caller\nhas already held a raw-spin-lock (bucket lock).

However, it will make the concurrent\noverwrite procedures on the same CPU return unexpected -E2BIG error when\nthe map is full.\n\nTherefore, the patch fixes the lock problem by breaking the cancelling\nof bpf_timer into two steps for PREEMPT_RT:\n1) use hrtimer_try_to_cancel() and check its return value\n2) if the timer is running, use hrtimer_cancel() through a kworker to\n   cancel it again\nConsidering that the current implementation of hrtimer_cancel() will try\nto acquire a being held softirq_expiry_lock when the current timer is\nrunning, these steps above are reasonable. However, it also has\ndownside. When the timer is running, the cancelling of the timer is\ndelayed when releasing the last map uref. The delay is also fixable\n(e.g., break the cancelling of bpf timer into two parts: one part in\nlocked scope, another one in unlocked scope), it can be revised later if\nnecessary.\n\nIt is a bit hard to decide the right fix tag. One reason is that the\nproblem depends on PREEMPT_RT which is enabled in v6.12. Considering the\nsoftirq_expiry_lock lock exists since v5.4 and bpf_timer is introduced\nin v5.15, the bpf_timer commit is used in the fixes tag and an extra\ndepends-on tag is added to state the dependency on PREEMPT_RT.\n\nDepends-on: v6.12+ with PREEMPT_RT enabled",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nKVM: x86: Load DR6 with guest value only before entering .vcpu_run() loop\n\nMove the conditional loading of hardware DR6 with the guest's DR6 value\nout of the core .vcpu_run() loop to fix a bug where KVM can load hardware\nwith a stale vcpu->arch.dr6.\n\nWhen the guest accesses a DR and host userspace isn't debugging the guest,\nKVM disables DR interception and loads the guest's values into hardware on\nVM-Enter and saves them on VM-Exit.  This allows the guest to access DRs\nat will, e.g. so that a sequence of DR accesses to configure a breakpoint\nonly generates one VM-Exit.\n\nFor DR0-DR3, the logic/behavior is identical between VMX and SVM, and also\nidentical between KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED (userspace debugging the guest)\nand KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT (guest using DRs), and so KVM handles loading\nDR0-DR3 in common code, _outside_ of the core kvm_x86_ops.vcpu_run() loop.\n\nBut for DR6, the guest's value doesn't need to be loaded into hardware for\nKVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED, and SVM provides a dedicated VMCB field whereas\nVMX requires software to manually load the guest value, and so loading the\nguest's value into DR6 is handled by {svm,vmx}_vcpu_run(), i.e. is done\n_inside_ the core run loop.\n\nUnfortunately, saving the guest values on VM-Exit is initiated by common\nx86, again outside of the core run loop.  If the guest modifies DR6 (in\nhardware, when DR interception is disabled), and then the next VM-Exit is\na fastpath VM-Exit, KVM will reload hardware DR6 with vcpu->arch.dr6 and\nclobber the guest's actual value.\n\nThe bug shows up primarily with nested VMX because KVM handles the VMX\npreemption timer in the fastpath, and the window between hardware DR6\nbeing modified (in guest context) and DR6 being read by guest software is\norders of magnitude larger in a nested setup.  E.g. in non-nested, the\nVMX preemption timer would need to fire precisely between #DB injection\nand the #DB handler's read of DR6, whereas with a KVM-on-KVM setup, the\nwindow where hardware DR6 is \"dirty\" extends all the way from L1 writing\nDR6 to VMRESUME (in L1).\n\n    L1's view:\n    ==========\n    <L1 disables DR interception>\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640961: kvm_entry: vcpu 0\n A:  L1 Writes DR6\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640963: <hack>: Set DRs, DR6 = 0xffff0ff1\n\n B:        CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640967: kvm_exit: vcpu 0 reason EXTERNAL_INTERRUPT intr_info 0x800000ec\n\n D: L1 reads DR6, arch.dr6 = 0\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640969: <hack>: Sync DRs, DR6 = 0xffff0ff0\n\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640976: kvm_entry: vcpu 0\n    L2 reads DR6, L1 disables DR interception\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640980: kvm_exit: vcpu 0 reason DR_ACCESS info1 0x0000000000000216\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640983: kvm_entry: vcpu 0\n\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640983: <hack>: Set DRs, DR6 = 0xffff0ff0\n\n    L2 detects failure\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640987: kvm_exit: vcpu 0 reason HLT\n    L1 reads DR6 (confirms failure)\n           CPU 0/KVM-7289    [023] d....  2925.640990: <hack>: Sync DRs, DR6 = 0xffff0ff0\n\n    L0's view:\n    ==========\n    L2 reads DR6, arch.dr6 = 0\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.005610: kvm_exit: vcpu 23 reason DR_ACCESS info1 0x0000000000000216\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] .....  3410.005610: kvm_nested_vmexit: vcpu 23 reason DR_ACCESS info1 0x0000000000000216\n\n    L2 => L1 nested VM-Exit\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] .....  3410.005610: kvm_nested_vmexit_inject: reason: DR_ACCESS ext_inf1: 0x0000000000000216\n\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.005610: kvm_entry: vcpu 23\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.005611: kvm_exit: vcpu 23 reason VMREAD\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.005611: kvm_entry: vcpu 23\n          CPU 23/KVM-5046    [001] d....  3410.\n---truncated---",

This ensures that all existing thermal generic\nnetlink attributes remain unaffected.\n\n[ rjw: Subject edits ]",

While the order for a child is\nimpacted by the event order in the pinned_groups and flexible_groups. So\nthe order of pmu_ctx_list in the parent and child may be different.\n\nTo fix this problem, insert the perf_event_pmu_context to its proper place\nafter iteration of the pmu_ctx_list.\n\nThe follow testcase can trigger above warning:\n\n # perf record -e cycles --call-graph lbr -- taskset -c 3 ./a.out &\n # perf stat -e cpu-clock,cs -p xxx // xxx is the pid of a.out\n\n test.c\n\n void main() {\n        int count = 0;\n        pid_t pid;\n\n        printf(\"%d running\\n\", getpid());\n        sleep(30);\n        printf(\"running\\n\");\n\n        pid = fork();\n        if (pid == -1) {\n                printf(\"fork error\\n\");\n                return;\n        }\n        if (pid == 0) {\n                while (1) {\n                        count++;\n                }\n        } else {\n                while (1) {\n                        count++;\n                }\n        }\n }\n\nThe testcase first opens an LBR event, so it will allocate task_ctx_data,\nand then open tracepoint and software events, so the parent context will\nhave 3 different perf_event_pmu_contexts.

Unfortunately, the workaround code was testing whether @prev was\non SCX to decide whether to keep the task running. This is incorrect as the\ntask may be on SCX but no longer runnable.\n\nThis could lead to a non-runnable task to be returned from pick_task_scx()\nwhich cause interesting confusions and failures. e.g. A common failure mode\nis the task ending up with (!on_rq && on_cpu) state which can cause\npotential wakers to busy loop, which can easily lead to deadlocks.\n\nFix it by testing whether @prev has SCX_TASK_QUEUED set.

The ACPI implementation in the\nBIOS ensures that the opregion contents are synced to the embedded\ncontroller and it ensures that the registers (in particular CCI) are\nsynced back to the opregion on notifications. While there is an ACPI call\nthat syncs the actual registers to the opregion there is rarely a need to\ndo this and on some ACPI implementations it actually breaks in various\ninteresting ways.\n\nThe only reason to force a sync from the embedded controller is to poll\nCCI while notifications are disabled.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: abort vma_modify() on merge out of memory failure\n\nThe remainder of vma_modify() relies upon the vmg state remaining pristine\nafter a merge attempt.\n\nUsually this is the case, however in the one edge case scenario of a merge\nattempt failing not due to the specified range being unmergeable, but\nrather due to an out of memory error arising when attempting to commit the\nmerge, this assumption becomes untrue.\n\nThis results in vmg->start, end being modified, and thus the proceeding\nattempts to split the VMA will be done with invalid start/end values.\n\nThankfully, it is likely practically impossible for us to hit this in\nreality, as it would require a maple tree node pre-allocation failure that\nwould likely never happen due to it being 'too small to fail', i.e.  the\nkernel would simply keep retrying reclaim until it succeeded.\n\nHowever, this scenario remains theoretically possible, and what we are\ndoing here is wrong so we must correct it.\n\nThe safest option is, when this scenario occurs, to simply give up the\noperation.  If we cannot allocate memory to merge, then we cannot allocate\nmemory to split either (perhaps moreso!).\n\nAny scenario where this would be happening would be under very extreme\n(likely fatal) memory pressure, so it's best we give up early.\n\nSo there is no doubt it is appropriate to simply bail out in this\nscenario.\n\nHowever, in general we must if at all possible never assume VMG state is\nstable after a merge attempt, since merge operations update VMG fields. \nAs a result, additionally also make this clear by storing start, end in\nlocal variables.\n\nThe issue was reported originally by syzkaller, and by Brad Spengler (via\nan off-list discussion), and in both instances it manifested as a\ntriggering of the assert:\n\n\tVM_WARN_ON_VMG(start >= end, vmg);\n\nIn vma_merge_existing_range().\n\nIt seems at least one scenario in which this is occurring is one in which\nthe merge being attempted is due to an madvise() across multiple VMAs\nwhich looks like this:\n\n        start     end\n          |<------>|\n     |----------|------|\n     |   vma    | next |\n     |----------|------|\n\nWhen madvise_walk_vmas() is invoked, we first find vma in the above\n(determining prev to be equal to vma as we are offset into vma), and then\nenter the loop.\n\nWe determine the end of vma that forms part of the range we are\nmadvise()'ing by setting 'tmp' to this value:\n\n\t\t/* Here vma->vm_start <= start < (end|vma->vm_end) */\n\t\ttmp = vma->vm_end;\n\nWe then invoke the madvise() operation via visit(), letting prev get\nupdated to point to vma as part of the operation:\n\n\t\t/* Here vma->vm_start <= start < tmp <= (end|vma->vm_end). */\n\t\terror = visit(vma, &prev, start, tmp, arg);\n\nWhere the visit() function pointer in this instance is\nmadvise_vma_behavior().\n\nAs observed in syzkaller reports, it is ultimately madvise_update_vma()\nthat is invoked, calling vma_modify_flags_name() and vma_modify() in turn.\n\nThen, in vma_modify(), we attempt the merge:\n\n\tmerged = vma_merge_existing_range(vmg);\n\tif (merged)\n\t\treturn merged;\n\nWe invoke this with vmg->start, end set to start, tmp as such:\n\n        start  tmp\n          |<--->|\n     |----------|------|\n     |   vma    | next |\n     |----------|------|\n\nWe find ourselves in the merge right scenario, but the one in which we\ncannot remove the middle (we are offset into vma).\n\nHere we have a special case where vmg->start, end get set to perhaps\nunintuitive values - we intended to shrink the middle VMA and expand the\nnext.\n\nThis means vmg->start, end are set to...  vma->vm_start, start.\n\nNow the commit_merge() fails, and vmg->start, end are left like this. \nThis means we return to the rest of vma_modify() with vmg->start, end\n(here denoted as start', end') set as:\n\n  start' end'\n     |<-->|\n     |----------|------|\n     |   vma    | next |\n     |----------|------|\n\nSo we now erroneously try to split accordingly.

This is because these IOs\n    may be necessary to finish a zone.\n\nThe commit 06f364284794 (\"btrfs: do proper folio cleanup when\ncow_file_range() failed\") moved the unlock code from the inside of the\nloop to the outside. So, previously, the allocated extents are unlocked\njust after the allocation and so before returning from the function.\nHowever, they are no longer unlocked on the case (2) above. That caused\nthe hang issue.\n\nFix the issue by modifying the 'end' to the end of the allocated\nrange. Then, we can exit the loop and the same unlock code can properly\nhandle the case.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbus: mhi: host: pci_generic: Use pci_try_reset_function() to avoid deadlock\n\nThere are multiple places from where the recovery work gets scheduled\nasynchronously. Also, there are multiple places where the caller waits\nsynchronously for the recovery to be completed. One such place is during\nthe PM shutdown() callback.\n\nIf the device is not alive during recovery_work, it will try to reset the\ndevice using pci_reset_function(). This function internally will take the\ndevice_lock() first before resetting the device. By this time, if the lock\nhas already been acquired, then recovery_work will get stalled while\nwaiting for the lock. And if the lock was already acquired by the caller\nwhich waits for the recovery_work to be completed, it will lead to\ndeadlock.\n\nThis is what happened on the X1E80100 CRD device when the device died\nbefore shutdown() callback. Driver core calls the driver's shutdown()\ncallback while holding the device_lock() leading to deadlock.\n\nAnd this deadlock scenario can occur on other paths as well, like during\nthe PM suspend() callback, where the driver core would hold the\ndevice_lock() before calling driver's suspend() callback. And if the\nrecovery_work was already started, it could lead to deadlock. This is also\nobserved on the X1E80100 CRD.\n\nSo to fix both issues, use pci_try_reset_function() in recovery_work. This\nfunction first checks for the availability of the device_lock() before\ntrying to reset the device. If the lock is available, it will acquire it\nand reset the device. Otherwise, it will return -EAGAIN. If that happens,\nrecovery_work will fail with the error message \"Recovery failed\" as not\nmuch could be done.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfbdev: hyperv_fb: Fix hang in kdump kernel when on Hyper-V Gen 2 VMs\n\nGen 2 Hyper-V VMs boot via EFI and have a standard EFI framebuffer\ndevice. When the kdump kernel runs in such a VM, loading the efifb\ndriver may hang because of accessing the framebuffer at the wrong\nmemory address.\n\nThe scenario occurs when the hyperv_fb driver in the original kernel\nmoves the framebuffer to a different MMIO address because of conflicts\nwith an already-running efifb or simplefb driver. The hyperv_fb driver\nthen informs Hyper-V of the change, which is allowed by the Hyper-V FB\nVMBus device protocol. However, when the kexec command loads the kdump\nkernel into crash memory via the kexec_file_load() system call, the\nsystem call doesn't know the framebuffer has moved, and it sets up the\nkdump screen_info using the original framebuffer address. The transition\nto the kdump kernel does not go through the Hyper-V host, so Hyper-V\ndoes not reset the framebuffer address like it would do on a reboot.\nWhen efifb tries to run, it accesses a non-existent framebuffer\naddress, which traps to the Hyper-V host. After many such accesses,\nthe Hyper-V host thinks the guest is being malicious, and throttles\nthe guest to the point that it runs very slowly or appears to have hung.\n\nWhen the kdump kernel is loaded into crash memory via the kexec_load()\nsystem call, the problem does not occur. In this case, the kexec command\nbuilds the screen_info table itself in user space from data returned\nby the FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO ioctl against /dev/fb0, which gives it the\nnew framebuffer location.\n\nThis problem was originally reported in 2020 [1], resulting in commit\n3cb73bc3fa2a (\"hyperv_fb: Update screen_info after removing old\nframebuffer\"). This commit solved the problem by setting orig_video_isVGA\nto 0, so the kdump kernel was unaware of the EFI framebuffer. The efifb\ndriver did not try to load, and no hang occurred. But in 2024, commit\nc25a19afb81c (\"fbdev/hyperv_fb: Do not clear global screen_info\")\neffectively reverted 3cb73bc3fa2a. Commit c25a19afb81c has no reference\nto 3cb73bc3fa2a, so perhaps it was done without knowing the implications\nthat were reported with 3cb73bc3fa2a. In any case, as of commit\nc25a19afb81c, the original problem came back again.\n\nInterestingly, the hyperv_drm driver does not have this problem because\nit never moves the framebuffer. The difference is that the hyperv_drm\ndriver removes any conflicting framebuffers *before* allocating an MMIO\naddress, while the hyperv_fb drivers removes conflicting framebuffers\n*after* allocating an MMIO address. With the \"after\" ordering, hyperv_fb\nmay encounter a conflict and move the framebuffer to a different MMIO\naddress. But the conflict is essentially bogus because it is removed\na few lines of code later.\n\nRather than fix the problem with the approach from 2020 in commit\n3cb73bc3fa2a, instead slightly reorder the steps in hyperv_fb so\nconflicting framebuffers are removed before allocating an MMIO address.\nThen the default framebuffer MMIO address should always be available, and\nthere's never any confusion about which framebuffer address the kdump\nkernel should use -- it's always the original address provided by\nthe Hyper-V host. This approach is already used by the hyperv_drm\ndriver, and is consistent with the usage guidelines at the head of\nthe module with the function aperture_remove_conflicting_devices().\n\nThis approach also solves a related minor problem when kexec_load()\nis used to load the kdump kernel. With current code, unbinding and\nrebinding the hyperv_fb driver could result in the framebuffer moving\nback to the default framebuffer address, because on the rebind there\nare no conflicts. If such a move is done after the kdump kernel is\nloaded with the new framebuffer address, at kdump time it could again\nhave the wrong address.\n\nThis problem and fix are described in terms of the kdump kernel, but\nit can also occur\n---truncated---",

This has been seen to\n  result in QEMU crashes where SVE is used by memmove(), as reported by\n  Eric Auger:\n\n  https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-68997\n\n* Host SVE state is discarded *after* modification by ptrace, which was an\n  unintentional ptrace ABI change introduced with lazy discarding of SVE state.\n\n* The host FPMR value can be discarded when running a non-protected VM,\n  where FPMR support is not exposed to a VM, and that VM uses\n  FPSIMD/SVE. In these cases the hyp code does not save the host's FPMR\n  before unbinding the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state, leaving a stale\n  value in memory.\n\nAvoid these by eagerly saving and \"flushing\" the host's FPSIMD/SVE/SME\nstate when loading a vCPU such that KVM does not need to save any of the\nhost's FPSIMD/SVE/SME state. For clarity, fpsimd_kvm_prepare() is\nremoved and the necessary call to fpsimd_save_and_flush_cpu_state() is\nplaced in kvm_arch_vcpu_load_fp().

Instead, it erroneously cleared the skip flag, which\nwould cause the ring to get stuck, as future events won't match the\nmissed TD which is never removed from the queue until it's cancelled.\n\nThis buggy logic seems to have been in place substantially unchanged\nsince the 3.x series over 10 years ago, which probably speaks first\nand foremost about relative rarity of this case in normal usage, but\nby the spec I see no reason why it shouldn't be possible.\n\nAfter d56b0b2ab142, TDs are immediately skipped when handling those\nStopped events. This poses a potential problem in case of Stopped -\nLength Invalid, which occurs either on completed TDs (likely already\ngiven back) or Link and No-Op TRBs. Such event won't be recognized\nas matching any TD (unless it's the rare Link TRB inside a TD) and\nwill result in skipping all pending TDs, giving them back possibly\nbefore they are done, risking isoc data loss and maybe UAF by HW.\n\nAs a compromise, don't skip and don't clear the skip flag on this\nkind of event. Then the next event will skip missed TDs. A downside\nof not handling Stopped - Length Invalid on a Link inside a TD is\nthat if the TD is cancelled, its actual length will not be updated\nto account for TRBs (silently) completed before the TD was stopped.\n\nI had no luck producing this sequence of completion events so there\nis no compelling demonstration of any resulting disaster. It may be\na very rare, obscure condition. The sole motivation for this patch\nis that if such unlikely event does occur, I'd rather risk reporting\na cancelled partially done isoc frame as empty than gamble with UAF.\n\nThis will be fixed more properly by looking at Stopped event's TRB\npointer when making skipping decisions, but such rework is unlikely\nto be backported to v6.12, which will stay around for a few years.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nudp: Fix memory accounting leak.\n\nMatt Dowling reported a weird UDP memory usage issue.\n\nUnder normal operation, the UDP memory usage reported in /proc/net/sockstat\nremains close to zero.  However, it occasionally spiked to 524,288 pages\nand never dropped.  Moreover, the value doubled when the application was\nterminated.  Finally, it caused intermittent packet drops.\n\nWe can reproduce the issue with the script below [0]:\n\n  1. /proc/net/sockstat reports 0 pages\n\n    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:\n    UDP: inuse 1 mem 0\n\n  2. Run the script till the report reaches 524,288\n\n    # python3 test.py & sleep 5\n    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:\n    UDP: inuse 3 mem 524288  <-- (INT_MAX + 1) >> PAGE_SHIFT\n\n  3. Kill the socket and confirm the number never drops\n\n    # pkill python3 && sleep 5\n    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:\n    UDP: inuse 1 mem 524288\n\n  4. (necessary since v6.0) Trigger proto_memory_pcpu_drain()\n\n    # python3 test.py & sleep 1 && pkill python3\n\n  5. The number doubles\n\n    # cat /proc/net/sockstat | grep UDP:\n    UDP: inuse 1 mem 1048577\n\nThe application set INT_MAX to SO_RCVBUF, which triggered an integer\noverflow in udp_rmem_release().\n\nWhen a socket is close()d, udp_destruct_common() purges its receive\nqueue and sums up skb->truesize in the queue.  This total is calculated\nand stored in a local unsigned integer variable.\n\nThe total size is then passed to udp_rmem_release() to adjust memory\naccounting.  However, because the function takes a signed integer\nargument, the total size can wrap around, causing an overflow.\n\nThen, the released amount is calculated as follows:\n\n  1) Add size to sk->sk_forward_alloc.\n  2) Round down sk->sk_forward_alloc to the nearest lower multiple of\n      PAGE_SIZE and assign it to amount.\n  3) Subtract amount from sk->sk_forward_alloc.\n  4) Pass amount >> PAGE_SHIFT to __sk_mem_reduce_allocated().\n\nWhen the issue occurred, the total in udp_destruct_common() was 2147484480\n(INT_MAX + 833), which was cast to -2147482816 in udp_rmem_release().\n\nAt 1) sk->sk_forward_alloc is changed from 3264 to -2147479552, and\n2) sets -2147479552 to amount.  3) reverts the wraparound, so we don't\nsee a warning in inet_sock_destruct().  However, udp_memory_allocated\nends up doubling at 4).\n\nSince commit 3cd3399dd7a8 (\"net: implement per-cpu reserves for\nmemory_allocated\"), memory usage no longer doubles immediately after\na socket is close()d because __sk_mem_reduce_allocated() caches the\namount in udp_memory_per_cpu_fw_alloc.  However, the next time a UDP\nsocket receives a packet, the subtraction takes effect, causing UDP\nmemory usage to double.\n\nThis issue makes further memory allocation fail once the socket's\nsk->sk_rmem_alloc exceeds net.ipv4.udp_rmem_min, resulting in packet\ndrops.\n\nTo prevent this issue, let's use unsigned int for the calculation and\ncall sk_forward_alloc_add() only once for the small delta.\n\nNote that first_packet_length() also potentially has the same problem.\n\n[0]:\nfrom socket import *\n\nSO_RCVBUFFORCE = 33\nINT_MAX = (2 ** 31) - 1\n\ns = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)\ns.bind(('', 0))\ns.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUFFORCE, INT_MAX)\n\nc = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)\nc.connect(s.getsockname())\n\ndata = b'a' * 100\n\nwhile True:\n    c.send(data)",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nRevert \"smb: client: fix TCP timers deadlock after rmmod\"\n\nThis reverts commit e9f2517a3e18a54a3943c098d2226b245d488801.\n\nCommit e9f2517a3e18 (\"smb: client: fix TCP timers deadlock after\nrmmod\") is intended to fix a null-ptr-deref in LOCKDEP, which is\nmentioned as CVE-2024-54680, but is actually did not fix anything;\nThe issue can be reproduced on top of it. [0]\n\nAlso, it reverted the change by commit ef7134c7fc48 (\"smb: client:\nFix use-after-free of network namespace.\") and introduced a real\nissue by reviving the kernel TCP socket.\n\nWhen a reconnect happens for a CIFS connection, the socket state\ntransitions to FIN_WAIT_1.  Then, inet_csk_clear_xmit_timers_sync()\nin tcp_close() stops all timers for the socket.\n\nIf an incoming FIN packet is lost, the socket will stay at FIN_WAIT_1\nforever, and such sockets could be leaked up to net.ipv4.tcp_max_orphans.\n\nUsually, FIN can be retransmitted by the peer, but if the peer aborts\nthe connection, the issue comes into reality.\n\nI warned about this privately by pointing out the exact report [1],\nbut the bogus fix was finally merged.\n\nSo, we should not stop the timers to finally kill the connection on\nour side in that case, meaning we must not use a kernel socket for\nTCP whose sk->sk_net_refcnt is 0.\n\nThe kernel socket does not have a reference to its netns to make it\npossible to tear down netns without cleaning up every resource in it.\n\nFor example, tunnel devices use a UDP socket internally, but we can\ndestroy netns without removing such devices and let it complete\nduring exit.  Otherwise, netns would be leaked when the last application\ndied.\n\nHowever, this is problematic for TCP sockets because TCP has timers to\nclose the connection gracefully even after the socket is close()d.  The\nlifetime of the socket and its netns is different from the lifetime of\nthe underlying connection.\n\nIf the socket user does not maintain the netns lifetime, the timer could\nbe fired after the socket is close()d and its netns is freed up, resulting\nin use-after-free.\n\nActually, we have seen so many similar issues and converted such sockets\nto have a reference to netns.\n\nThat's why I converted the CIFS client socket to have a reference to\nnetns (sk->sk_net_refcnt == 1), which is somehow mentioned as out-of-scope\nof CIFS and technically wrong in e9f2517a3e18, but **is in-scope and right\nfix**.\n\nRegarding the LOCKDEP issue, we can prevent the module unload by\nbumping the module refcount when switching the LOCKDDEP key in\nsock_lock_init_class_and_name(). [2]\n\nFor a while, let's revert the bogus fix.\n\nNote that now we can use sk_net_refcnt_upgrade() for the socket\nconversion, but I'll do so later separately to make backport easy.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvhost-scsi: Fix handling of multiple calls to vhost_scsi_set_endpoint\n\nIf vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times without a\nvhost_scsi_clear_endpoint between them, we can hit multiple bugs\nfound by Haoran Zhang:\n\n1. Use-after-free when no tpgs are found:\n\nThis fixes a use after free that occurs when vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is\ncalled more than once and calls after the first call do not find any\ntpgs to add to the vs_tpg. When vhost_scsi_set_endpoint first finds\ntpgs to add to the vs_tpg array match=true, so we will do:\n\nvhost_vq_set_backend(vq, vs_tpg);\n...\n\nkfree(vs->vs_tpg);\nvs->vs_tpg = vs_tpg;\n\nIf vhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called again and no tpgs are found\nmatch=false so we skip the vhost_vq_set_backend call leaving the\npointer to the vs_tpg we then free via:\n\nkfree(vs->vs_tpg);\nvs->vs_tpg = vs_tpg;\n\nIf a scsi request is then sent we do:\n\nvhost_scsi_handle_vq -> vhost_scsi_get_req -> vhost_vq_get_backend\n\nwhich sees the vs_tpg we just did a kfree on.\n\n2. Tpg dir removal hang:\n\nThis patch fixes an issue where we cannot remove a LIO/target layer\ntpg (and structs above it like the target) dir due to the refcount\ndropping to -1.\n\nThe problem is that if vhost_scsi_set_endpoint detects a tpg is already\nin the vs->vs_tpg array or if the tpg has been removed so\ntarget_depend_item fails, the undepend goto handler will do\ntarget_undepend_item on all tpgs in the vs_tpg array dropping their\nrefcount to 0. At this time vs_tpg contains both the tpgs we have added\nin the current vhost_scsi_set_endpoint call as well as tpgs we added in\nprevious calls which are also in vs->vs_tpg.\n\nLater, when vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint runs it will do\ntarget_undepend_item on all the tpgs in the vs->vs_tpg which will drop\ntheir refcount to -1. Userspace will then not be able to remove the tpg\nand will hang when it tries to do rmdir on the tpg dir.\n\n3. Tpg leak:\n\nThis fixes a bug where we can leak tpgs and cause them to be\nun-removable because the target name is overwritten when\nvhost_scsi_set_endpoint is called multiple times but with different\ntarget names.\n\nThe bug occurs if a user has called VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT and setup\na vhost-scsi device to target/tpg mapping, then calls\nVHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT again with a new target name that has tpgs we\nhaven't seen before (target1 has tpg1 but target2 has tpg2). When this\nhappens we don't teardown the old target tpg mapping and just overwrite\nthe target name and the vs->vs_tpg array. Later when we do\nvhost_scsi_clear_endpoint, we are passed in either target1 or target2's\nname and we will only match that target's tpgs when we loop over the\nvs->vs_tpg. We will then return from the function without doing\ntarget_undepend_item on the tpgs.\n\nBecause of all these bugs, it looks like being able to call\nvhost_scsi_set_endpoint multiple times was never supported. The major\nuser, QEMU, already has checks to prevent this use case. So to fix the\nissues, this patch prevents vhost_scsi_set_endpoint from being called\nif it's already successfully added tpgs. To add, remove or change the\ntpg config or target name, you must do a vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint\nfirst.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mm/pat: Fix VM_PAT handling when fork() fails in copy_page_range()\n\nIf track_pfn_copy() fails, we already added the dst VMA to the maple\ntree. As fork() fails, we'll cleanup the maple tree, and stumble over\nthe dst VMA for which we neither performed any reservation nor copied\nany page tables.\n\nConsequently untrack_pfn() will see VM_PAT and try obtaining the\nPAT information from the page table -- which fails because the page\ntable was not copied.\n\nThe easiest fix would be to simply clear the VM_PAT flag of the dst VMA\nif track_pfn_copy() fails. However, the whole thing is about \"simply\"\nclearing the VM_PAT flag is shaky as well: if we passed track_pfn_copy()\nand performed a reservation, but copying the page tables fails, we'll\nsimply clear the VM_PAT flag, not properly undoing the reservation ...\nwhich is also wrong.\n\nSo let's fix it properly: set the VM_PAT flag only if the reservation\nsucceeded (leaving it clear initially), and undo the reservation if\nanything goes wrong while copying the page tables: clearing the VM_PAT\nflag after undoing the reservation.\n\nNote that any copied page table entries will get zapped when the VMA will\nget removed later, after copy_page_range() succeeded; as VM_PAT is not set\nthen, we won't try cleaning VM_PAT up once more and untrack_pfn() will be\nhappy.

Since it does not use the\nunused_bg_lock, it is possible for the following race to occur:\n\nbtrfs_create_pending_block_groups            btrfs_mark_bg_unused\n                                           if list_empty // false\n        list_del_init\n        clear_bit\n                                           else if (test_bit) // true\n                                                list_move_tail\n\nAnd we get into the exact same broken ref count and invalid new_bgs\nstate for transaction cleanup that BLOCK_GROUP_FLAG_NEW was designed to\nprevent.\n\nThe broken refcount aspect will result in a warning like:\n\n  [1272.943527] refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.\n  [1272.943967] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 61 at lib/refcount.c:28 refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.944731] Modules linked in: btrfs virtio_net xor zstd_compress raid6_pq null_blk [last unloaded: btrfs]\n  [1272.945550] CPU: 1 UID: 0 PID: 61 Comm: kworker/u32:1 Kdump: loaded Tainted: G        W          6.14.0-rc5+ #108\n  [1272.946368] Tainted: [W]=WARN\n  [1272.946585] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS Arch Linux 1.16.3-1-1 04/01/2014\n  [1272.947273] Workqueue: btrfs_discard btrfs_discard_workfn [btrfs]\n  [1272.947788] RIP: 0010:refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.949532] RSP: 0018:ffffbf1200247df0 EFLAGS: 00010282\n  [1272.949901] RAX: 0000000000000000 RBX: ffffa14b00e3f800 RCX: 0000000000000000\n  [1272.950437] RDX: 0000000000000000 RSI: ffffbf1200247c78 RDI: 00000000ffffdfff\n  [1272.950986] RBP: ffffa14b00dc2860 R08: 00000000ffffdfff R09: ffffffff90526268\n  [1272.951512] R10: ffffffff904762c0 R11: 0000000063666572 R12: ffffa14b00dc28c0\n  [1272.952024] R13: 0000000000000000 R14: ffffa14b00dc2868 R15: 000001285dcd12c0\n  [1272.952850] FS:  0000000000000000(0000) GS:ffffa14d33c40000(0000) knlGS:0000000000000000\n  [1272.953458] CS:  0010 DS: 0000 ES: 0000 CR0: 0000000080050033\n  [1272.953931] CR2: 00007f838cbda000 CR3: 000000010104e000 CR4: 00000000000006f0\n  [1272.954474] Call Trace:\n  [1272.954655]  <TASK>\n  [1272.954812]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.955173]  ? __warn.cold+0x93/0xd7\n  [1272.955487]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.955816]  ? report_bug+0xe7/0x120\n  [1272.956103]  ? handle_bug+0x53/0x90\n  [1272.956424]  ? exc_invalid_op+0x13/0x60\n  [1272.956700]  ? asm_exc_invalid_op+0x16/0x20\n  [1272.957011]  ? refcount_warn_saturate+0xba/0x110\n  [1272.957399]  btrfs_discard_cancel_work.cold+0x26/0x2b [btrfs]\n  [1272.957853]  btrfs_put_block_group.cold+0x5d/0x8e [btrfs]\n  [1272.958289]  btrfs_discard_workfn+0x194/0x380 [btrfs]\n  [1272.958729]  process_one_work+0x130/0x290\n  [1272.959026]  worker_thread+0x2ea/0x420\n  [1272.959335]  ? __pfx_worker_thread+0x10/0x10\n  [1272.959644]  kthread+0xd7/0x1c0\n  [1272.959872]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n  [1272.960172]  ret_from_fork+0x30/0x50\n  [1272.960474]  ? __pfx_kthread+0x10/0x10\n  [1272.960745]  ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30\n  [1272.961035]  </TASK>\n  [1272.961238] ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---\n\nThough we have seen them in the async discard workfn as well.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsctp: detect and prevent references to a freed transport in sendmsg\n\nsctp_sendmsg() re-uses associations and transports when possible by\ndoing a lookup based on the socket endpoint and the message destination\naddress, and then sctp_sendmsg_to_asoc() sets the selected transport in\nall the message chunks to be sent.\n\nThere's a possible race condition if another thread triggers the removal\nof that selected transport, for instance, by explicitly unbinding an\naddress with setsockopt(SCTP_SOCKOPT_BINDX_REM), after the chunks have\nbeen set up and before the message is sent. This can happen if the send\nbuffer is full, during the period when the sender thread temporarily\nreleases the socket lock in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf().\n\nThis causes the access to the transport data in\nsctp_outq_select_transport(), when the association outqueue is flushed,\nto result in a use-after-free read.\n\nThis change avoids this scenario by having sctp_transport_free() signal\nthe freeing of the transport, tagging it as \"dead\". In order to do this,\nthe patch restores the \"dead\" bit in struct sctp_transport, which was\nremoved in\ncommit 47faa1e4c50e (\"sctp: remove the dead field of sctp_transport\").\n\nThen, in the scenario where the sender thread has released the socket\nlock in sctp_wait_for_sndbuf(), the bit is checked again after\nre-acquiring the socket lock to detect the deletion. This is done while\nholding a reference to the transport to prevent it from being freed in\nthe process.\n\nIf the transport was deleted while the socket lock was relinquished,\nsctp_sendmsg_to_asoc() will return -EAGAIN to let userspace retry the\nsend.\n\nThe bug was found by a private syzbot instance (see the error report [1]\nand the C reproducer that triggers it [2]).",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: Fix null-ptr-deref by sock_lock_init_class_and_name() and rmmod.\n\nWhen I ran the repro [0] and waited a few seconds, I observed two\nLOCKDEP splats: a warning immediately followed by a null-ptr-deref. [1]\n\nReproduction Steps:\n\n  1) Mount CIFS\n  2) Add an iptables rule to drop incoming FIN packets for CIFS\n  3) Unmount CIFS\n  4) Unload the CIFS module\n  5) Remove the iptables rule\n\nAt step 3), the CIFS module calls sock_release() for the underlying\nTCP socket, and it returns quickly.  However, the socket remains in\nFIN_WAIT_1 because incoming FIN packets are dropped.\n\nAt this point, the module's refcnt is 0 while the socket is still\nalive, so the following rmmod command succeeds.\n\n  # ss -tan\n  State      Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address:Port  Peer Address:Port\n  FIN-WAIT-1 0      477        10.0.2.15:51062   10.0.0.137:445\n\n  # lsmod | grep cifs\n  cifs                 1159168  0\n\nThis highlights a discrepancy between the lifetime of the CIFS module\nand the underlying TCP socket.  Even after CIFS calls sock_release()\nand it returns, the TCP socket does not die immediately in order to\nclose the connection gracefully.\n\nWhile this is generally fine, it causes an issue with LOCKDEP because\nCIFS assigns a different lock class to the TCP socket's sk->sk_lock\nusing sock_lock_init_class_and_name().\n\nOnce an incoming packet is processed for the socket or a timer fires,\nsk->sk_lock is acquired.\n\nThen, LOCKDEP checks the lock context in check_wait_context(), where\nhlock_class() is called to retrieve the lock class.  However, since\nthe module has already been unloaded, hlock_class() logs a warning\nand returns NULL, triggering the null-ptr-deref.\n\nIf LOCKDEP is enabled, we must ensure that a module calling\nsock_lock_init_class_and_name() (CIFS, NFS, etc) cannot be unloaded\nwhile such a socket is still alive to prevent this issue.\n\nLet's hold the module reference in sock_lock_init_class_and_name()\nand release it when the socket is freed in sk_prot_free().\n\nNote that sock_lock_init() clears sk->sk_owner for svc_create_socket()\nthat calls sock_lock_init_class_and_name() for a listening socket,\nwhich clones a socket by sk_clone_lock() without GFP_ZERO.\n\n[0]:\nCIFS_SERVER=\"10.0.0.137\"\nCIFS_PATH=\"//${CIFS_SERVER}/Users/Administrator/Desktop/CIFS_TEST\"\nDEV=\"enp0s3\"\nCRED=\"/root/WindowsCredential.txt\"\n\nMNT=$(mktemp -d /tmp/XXXXXX)\nmount -t cifs ${CIFS_PATH} ${MNT} -o vers=3.0,credentials=${CRED},cache=none,echo_interval=1\n\niptables -A INPUT -s ${CIFS_SERVER} -j DROP\n\nfor i in $(seq 10);\ndo\n    umount ${MNT}\n    rmmod cifs\n    sleep 1\ndone\n\nrm -r ${MNT}\n\niptables -D INPUT -s ${CIFS_SERVER} -j DROP\n\n[1]:\nDEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(1)\nWARNING: CPU: 10 PID: 0 at kernel/locking/lockdep.c:234 hlock_class (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:234 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:223)\nModules linked in: cifs_arc4 nls_ucs2_utils cifs_md4 [last unloaded: cifs]\nCPU: 10 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/10 Not tainted 6.14.0 #36\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:hlock_class (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:234 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:223)\n...\nCall Trace:\n <IRQ>\n __lock_acquire (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:4853 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5178)\n lock_acquire (kernel/locking/lockdep.c:469 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5853 kernel/locking/lockdep.c:5816)\n _raw_spin_lock_nested (kernel/locking/spinlock.c:379)\n tcp_v4_rcv (./include/linux/skbuff.h:1678 ./include/net/tcp.h:2547 net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:2350)\n...\n\nBUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000000c4\n PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode\n PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page\nPGD 0\nOops: Oops: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP NOPTI\nCPU: 10 UID: 0 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/10 Tainted: G        W          6.14.0 #36\nTainted: [W]=WARN\nHardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS rel-1.16.0-0-gd239552ce722-prebuilt.qemu.org 04/01/2014\nRIP: 0010:__lock_acquire (kernel/\n---truncated---",

A Security vulnerability has been found starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to 1.10.3 and 1.11.3 on several director endpoints of REST API. To reproduce this vulnerability an authenticated user with permission to access the Director is required (plus api access with regard to the api endpoints). And even though some of these Icinga Director users are restricted from accessing certain objects, are able to retrieve information related to them if their name is known. This makes it possible to change the configuration of these objects by those Icinga Director users restricted from accessing them. This results in further exploitation, data breaches and sensitive information disclosure. Affected endpoints include icingaweb2/director/service, if the host name is left out of the query; icingaweb2/directore/notification; icingaweb2/director/serviceset; and icingaweb2/director/scheduled-downtime. In addition, the endpoint `icingaweb2/director/services?host=filteredHostName` returns a status code 200 even though the services for the host is filtered. This in turn lets the restricted user know that the host `filteredHostName` exists even though the user is restricted from accessing it.  This could again result in further exploitation of this information and data breaches. Icinga Director has patches in versions 1.10.3 and 1.11.1.

When a user enters no PIN at all, `pam_get_pwd` will never initialize the password buffer pointer and as such `cleanse` will try to dereference an uninitialized pointer. On my system this pointer happens to have the value 3 most of the time when running sudo and as such it will segfault.

Starting in version 0.7.0 and prior to versions 0.7.15 and 0.8.3, Himmelblau is vulnerable to leaking credentials in debug logs.

Both issues pose a risk of exposing sensitive credentials, particularly in environments where debug logging is enabled. Himmelblau versions 0.7.15 and 0.8.3 contain a patch that fixes both issues. Some workarounds are available for users who are unable to upgrade. For the **logon compliance script issue**, disable the `logon_script` option in `/etc/himmelblau/himmelblau.conf`, and avoid using the `-d` flag when starting the `himmelblaud` daemon.

This \"fast reconnect\" avoids having to wait for a session timeout (up to ~90s) until a new connection is established. Even a 1-byte UDP packet just containing the fastd packet type header can trigger a much larger handshake packet (~150 bytes of UDP payload). Including IPv4 and UDP headers, the resulting amplification factor is roughly 12-13.

    "description": "In some circumstances, debug artifacts uploaded by the CodeQL Action after a failed code scanning workflow run may contain the environment variables from the workflow run, including any secrets that were exposed as environment variables to the workflow. Users with read access to the repository would be able to access this artifact, containing any secrets from the environment. This vulnerability is patched in CodeQL Action version 3.28.3 or later, or CodeQL CLI version 2.20.3 or later.\n\nFor some affected workflow runs, the exposed environment variables in the debug artifacts included a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` for the workflow run, which has access to the repository in which the workflow ran, and all the permissions specified in the workflow or job. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is valid until the job completes or 24 hours has elapsed, whichever comes first.\n\nEnvironment variables are exposed only from workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions:\n- Code scanning workflow configured to scan the Java/Kotlin languages.\n- Running in a repository containing Kotlin source code.\n- Running with debug artifacts enabled.\n- Using CodeQL Action versions <= 3.28.2, and CodeQL CLI versions >= 2.9.2 (May 2022) and <= 2.20.2.\n- The workflow run fails before the CodeQL database is finalized within the `github/codeql-action/analyze` step.\n- Running in any GitHub environment: GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. Note: artifacts are only accessible to users within the same GitHub environment with access to the scanned repo.\n\nThe `GITHUB_TOKEN` exposed in this way would only have been valid for workflow runs that satisfy all of the following conditions, in addition to the conditions above:\n- Using CodeQL Action versions >= 3.26.11 (October 2024) and <= 3.28.2, or >= 2.26.11 and < 3.\n- Running in GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Cloud only (not valid on GitHub Enterprise Server).\n\nIn rare cases during advanced setup, logging of environment variables may also occur during database creation of Java, Swift, and C/C++. Please read the corresponding CodeQL CLI advisory GHSA-gqh3-9prg-j95m for more details.\n\nIn CodeQL CLI versions >= 2.9.2 and <= 2.20.2, the CodeQL Kotlin extractor logs all environment variables by default into an intermediate file during the process of creating a CodeQL database for Kotlin code. This is a part of the CodeQL CLI and is invoked by the CodeQL Action for analyzing Kotlin repositories. \n\nOn Actions, the environment variables logged include GITHUB_TOKEN, which grants permissions to the repository being scanned.\nThe intermediate file containing environment variables is deleted when finalizing the database, so it is not included in a successfully created database. It is, however, included in the debug artifact that is uploaded on a failed analysis run if the CodeQL Action was invoked in debug mode.\n\nTherefore, under these specific circumstances (incomplete database creation using the CodeQL Action in debug mode) an attacker with access to the debug artifact would gain unauthorized access to repository secrets from the environment, including both the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and any user-configured secrets made available via environment variables.\n\nThe impact of the `GITHUB_TOKEN` leaked in this environment is limited:\n- For workflows on GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Cloud using CodeQL Action versions >= 3.26.11 and <= 3.28.2, or >= 2.26.11 and < 3, which in turn use the `actions/artifacts v4` library, the debug artifact is uploaded before the workflow job completes. During this time the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is still valid, providing an opportunity for attackers to gain access to the repository.\n- For all other workflows, the debug artifact is uploaded after the workflow job completes, at which point the leaked `GITHUB_TOKEN` has been revoked and cannot be used to access the repository.",

This does not impact users that clone public repos without credentials, such as those using the auto-ig-build continuous integration infrastructure. This problem has been patched in release 1.8.9. Some workarounds are available. Users should ensure the IG repo they are publishing does not have username or credentials included in the `origin` URL.

The vulnerability arises from the core functionality `set_property_value`, which can be remotely triggered by users by crafting appropriate component requests and feeding in values of second and third parameter to the vulnerable function, leading to arbitrary changes to the python runtime status. With this finding at least five ways of vulnerability exploitation have been observed, stably resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), and Authentication Bypass attacks in almost every Django-Unicorn-based application. This issue has been addressed in version 0.62.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

If no databases are present in the default directory, the UI indicates that the user is unable to open any databases. The database file is an user-controlled value. This value is used in `.Join()` with the default directory, in order to get the full path of the database file to open. No checks are performed whether the database file that is eventually opened actually resides in the default directory `/db`.

This string concatenation is done unsafely and without escaping or encoding the user input. This allows an user, in many cases, to inject arbitrary parameters into the URI string. These parameters can be potentially dangerous depending on the libraries used. One of these dangerous parameters is `allowAllFiles` in the library `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`. Should this be set to `true`, the library enables running the `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` query on any file on the host machine (in this case, the machine that WhoDB is running on). By injecting `&allowAllFiles=true` into the connection URI and connecting to any MySQL server (such as an attacker-controlled one), the attacker is able to read local files.

    "description": "Authelia is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for applications via a web portal. If users are allowed to sign in via both username and email the regulation system treats these as separate login events. This leads to the regulation limitations being effectively doubled assuming an attacker using brute-force to find a user password. It's important to note that due to the effective operation of regulation where no user-facing sign of their regulation ban being visible either via timing or via API responses, it's effectively impossible to determine if a failure occurs due to a bad username password combination, or a effective ban blocking the attempt which heavily mitigates any form of brute-force. This occurs because the records and counting process for this system uses the method utilized for sign in rather than the effective username attribute. This has a minimal impact on account security, this impact is increased naturally in scenarios when there is no two-factor authentication required and weak passwords are used. This makes it a bit easier to brute-force a password. A patch for this issue has been applied to versions 4.38.19, and 4.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should 1. Not heavily modify the default settings in a way that ends up with shorter or less frequent regulation bans.

SecureDrop Server itself has multiple layers of built-in hardening, and is a dedicated physical machine exposed on the internet only via Tor hidden services for the Source and Journalist interfaces, and optionally via remote SSH access over another Tor hidden service. A newsroom's SecureDrop Workstation communicates only with its own dedicated SecureDrop Server.\n\nThe SecureDrop Client runs in a dedicated Qubes virtual machine, named `sd-app`, as part of the SecureDrop Workstation. The private OpenPGP key used to decrypt submissions and replies is stored in a separate virtual machine and never accessed directly. The vulnerability lies in the code responsible for downloading replies. The filename of the reply is obtained from the `Content-Disposition` HTTP header and used to write the encrypted reply on disk. Note that filenames are generated and sanitized server-side, and files are downloaded in an encrypted format, so a remote attacker who has not achieved server compromise, such as one posing as a source, could not craft the HTTP response necessary for this attack.\n\nWhile the filename is later checked to guard against path traversal before being moved into the Client\u2019s data storage directory, the file has already been written to a potentially arbitrary location.

    "description": "The SecureDrop Client is a desktop application for journalists to communicate with sources and work with submissions on the SecureDrop Workstation. Prior to versions 0.14.1 and 1.0.1, an attacker who has already gained code execution in a virtual machine on the SecureDrop Workstation could gain code execution in the `sd-log` virtual machine by sending a specially crafted log entry. The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and requires an attacker to already have code execution on one of the other virtual machines (VMs) of the system. Due to the Workstation's underlying usage of Qubes for strong isolation, the vulnerability would have allowed lateral movement between any log-enabled VM and the `sd-log` VM, but no further. The SecureDrop workstation collects logs centrally in an isolated virtual machine named `sd-log` for easy export for support and debugging purposes. The `sd-log`  VM is completely isolated from the internet and ingests logs via a narrow Qubes RPC policy that allows for specific inter-VM communication via the Xen vchan protocol used by Qubes's qrexec mechanism. A path traversal bug was found in the logic used to choose where to write the log file for a specific VM: the VM name, used unsanitized in the destination path in `sd-log`, is supplied by the logging VM itself instead of being read from a trusted source, such as the Qubes environment variable `QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN` that is used in the fixed implementation. An attacker could provide an arbitrary source VM name, possibly overwriting logs of other VMs, or writing a file named `syslog.log`, with attacker-controlled content, in arbitrary directories as a low-privileged user. A successful attack could potentially overwrite or add configuration to software that loads configuration files from a directory. This is exploitable to achieve code execution by setting the target directory to `/home/user/.config/autostart/` and letting it write `syslog.log`, because XFCE treats any file in that directory as a `.desktop` file regardless of its extension. Versions 0.14.1 and 1.0.1 contain a patch for this issue.",

When creating an S3 storage connection, the application allows users to specify a custom S3 endpoint URL via the s3_endpoint parameter. This endpoint URL is passed directly to the boto3 AWS SDK without proper validation or restrictions on the protocol or destination. The vulnerability allows an attacker to make the application send HTTP requests to arbitrary internal services by specifying them as the S3 endpoint. When the storage sync operation is triggered, the application attempts to make S3 API calls to the specified endpoint, effectively making HTTP requests to the target service and returning the response in error messages. This SSRF vulnerability enables attackers to bypass network segmentation and access internal services that should not be accessible from the external network. The vulnerability is particularly severe because error messages from failed requests contain the full response body, allowing data exfiltration from internal services.

When redirecting the output of `:display` to a register, Vim will free the register content before storing the new content in the register. Now when redirecting the `:display` command to a register that is being displayed, Vim will free the content while shortly afterwards trying to access it, which leads to a use-after-free. Vim pre 9.1.1115 checks in the ex_display() function, that it does not try to redirect to a register while displaying this register at the same time. However this check is not complete, and so Vim does not check the `+` and `*` registers (which typically donate the X11/clipboard registers, and when a clipboard connection is not possible will fall back to use register 0 instead. In Patch 9.1.1115 Vim will therefore skip outputting to register zero when trying to redirect to the clipboard registers `*` or `+`. Users are advised to upgrade.

    "description": "Duende.AccessTokenManagement is a set of .NET libraries that manage OAuth and OpenId Connect access tokens. Duende.AccessTokenManagement contains a race condition when requesting access tokens using the client credentials flow. Concurrent requests to obtain an access token using differing protocol parameters can return access tokens obtained with the wrong scope, resource indicator, or other protocol parameters. Such usage is somewhat atypical, and only a small percentage of users are likely to be affected. Duende.AccessTokenManagement can request access tokens using the client credentials flow in several ways. In basic usage, the client credentials flow is configured once and the parameters do not vary. In more advanced situations, requests with varying protocol parameters may be made by calling specific overloads of these methods: `HttpContext.GetClientAccessTokenAsync()` and `IClientCredentialsTokenManagementService.GetAccessTokenAsync()`. There are overloads of both of these methods that accept a `TokenRequestParameters` object that customizes token request parameters. However, concurrent requests with varying `TokenRequestParameters` will result in the same token for all concurrent calls. Most users can simply update the NuGet package to the latest version. Customizations of the `IClientCredentialsTokenCache` that derive from the default implementation (`DistributedClientCredentialsTokenCache`) will require a small code change, as its constructor was changed to add a dependency on the `ITokenRequestSynchronization` service. The synchronization service will need to be injected into the derived class and passed to the base constructor. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how Duende.AccessTokenManagement is used and on the security architecture of the solution. Most users will not be vulnerable to this issue. More advanced users may run into this issue by calling the methods specified above with customized token request parameters. The impact of obtaining an access token with different than intended protocol parameters will vary depending on application logic, security architecture, and the authorization policy of the resource servers.",

    "description": "vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. Multiple evaluation of a single expression is possible in the iterator target of a for loop. While the iterator expression cannot produce multiple writes, it can consume side effects produced in the loop body (e.g. read a storage variable updated in the loop body) and thus lead to unexpected program behavior. Specifically, reads in iterators which contain an ifexp (e.g. `for s: uint256 in ([read(), read()] if True else [])`) may interleave reads with writes in the loop body. Vyper for loops allow two kinds of iterator targets, namely the `range()` builtin and an iterable type, like SArray and DArray. During codegen, iterable lists are required to not produce any side-effects (in the following code, `range_scope` forces `iter_list` to be parsed in a constant context, which is checked against `is_constant`). However, this does not prevent the iterator from consuming side effects provided by the body of the loop. For SArrays on the other hand, `iter_list` is instantiated in the body of a `repeat` ir, so it can be evaluated several times.

In a Kubernetes environment, Ratify can be configured to authenticate to a private Azure Container Registry (ACR). The Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are configured in this setup. Users that configure a private ACR to be used with the Azure authentication providers may be impacted by a vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.3.2. Both Azure authentication providers attempt to exchange an Entra ID (EID) token for an ACR refresh token. However, Ratify\u2019s Azure authentication providers did not verify that the target registry is an ACR. This could have led to the EID token being presented to a non-ACR registry during token exchange. EID tokens with ACR access can potentially be extracted and abused if a user workload contains an image reference to a malicious registry. As of versions 1.2.3 and 1.3.2, the Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are updated to add new validation prior to EID token exchange. Validation relies upon registry domain validation against a pre-configured list of well-known ACR endpoints. EID token exchange will be executed only if at least one of the configured well-known domain suffixes (wildcard support included) matches the registry domain of the image reference.",

Since Zincati v0.0.24, this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user. In practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload. This primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket.

    "description": "Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel components under particular conditions.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 through <= 4.10.1, from 4.8.0 through <= 4.8.4, from 3.10.0 through <= 3.22.3.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.\n\n\n\nThis vulnerability is present in Camel's default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific\n\nheaders that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean component, to call another method\n\non the bean, than was coded in the application. In the camel-jms component, then a malicious header can be used to send\n\nthe message to another queue (on the same broker) than was coded in the application. This could also be seen by using the camel-exec component\n\n\n\n\nThe attacker would need to inject custom headers, such as HTTP protocols. So if you have Camel applications that are\n\ndirectly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attacker could include malicious HTTP headers in the HTTP requests\n\nthat are send to the Camel application.\n\n\n\n\nAll the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box.\n\nIn these conditions an attacker could be able to forge a Camel header name and make the bean component invoking other methods in the same bean.\n\nIn terms of usage of the default header filter strategy the list of components using that is: \n\n\n  *  camel-activemq\n  *  camel-activemq6\n  *  camel-amqp\n  *  camel-aws2-sqs\n  *  camel-azure-servicebus\n  *  camel-cxf-rest\n  *  camel-cxf-soap\n  *  camel-http\n  *  camel-jetty\n  *  camel-jms\n  *  camel-kafka\n  *  camel-knative\n  *  camel-mail\n  *  camel-nats\n  *  camel-netty-http\n  *  camel-platform-http\n  *  camel-rest\n  *  camel-sjms\n  *  camel-spring-rabbitmq\n  *  camel-stomp\n  *  camel-tahu\n  *  camel-undertow\n  *  camel-xmpp\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vulnerability arises due to a bug in the default filtering mechanism that only blocks headers starting with \"Camel\", \"camel\", or \"org.apache.camel.\".\u00a0\n\n\nMitigation:\u00a0You can easily work around this in your Camel applications by removing the\u00a0headers in your Camel routes. There are many ways of doing this, also\u00a0globally or per route. This means you could use the removeHeaders EIP, to filter out anything like \"cAmel, cAMEL\" etc, or in general everything not starting with \"Camel\", \"camel\" or \"org.apache.camel.\".",

    "description": "Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a Python implementation of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. In versions 0.8.0b2 and prior, the `secure_redundant_execution` function in feldman_vss.py attempts to mitigate fault injection attacks by executing a function multiple times and comparing results. However, several critical weaknesses exist. Python's execution environment cannot guarantee true isolation between redundant executions, the constant-time comparison implementation in Python is subject to timing variations, the randomized execution order and timing provide insufficient protection against sophisticated fault attacks, and the error handling may leak timing information about partial execution results. These limitations make the protection ineffective against targeted fault injection attacks, especially from attackers with physical access to the hardware. A successful fault injection attack could allow an attacker to bypass the redundancy check mechanisms, extract secret polynomial coefficients during share generation or verification, force the acceptance of invalid shares during verification, and/or manipulate the commitment verification process to accept fraudulent commitments. This undermines the core security guarantees of the Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme. As of time of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing exist, but other mitigations are available. Long-term remediation requires reimplementing the security-critical functions in a lower-level language like Rust. Short-term mitigations include deploying the software in environments with physical security controls, increasing the redundancy count (from 5 to a higher number) by modifying the source code, adding external verification of cryptographic operations when possible, considering using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key operations.",

    "description": "Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a Python implementation of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. In versions 0.8.0b2 and prior, the `feldman_vss` library contains timing side-channel vulnerabilities in its matrix operations, specifically within the `_find_secure_pivot` function and potentially other parts of `_secure_matrix_solve`. These vulnerabilities are due to Python's execution model, which does not guarantee constant-time execution. An attacker with the ability to measure the execution time of these functions (e.g., through repeated calls with carefully crafted inputs) could potentially recover secret information used in the Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. The `_find_secure_pivot` function, used during Gaussian elimination in `_secure_matrix_solve`, attempts to find a non-zero pivot element. However, the conditional statement `if matrix[row][col] != 0 and row_random < min_value:` has execution time that depends on the value of `matrix[row][col]`. This timing difference can be exploited by an attacker. The `constant_time_compare` function in this file also does not provide a constant-time guarantee. The Python implementation of matrix operations in the _find_secure_pivot and _secure_matrix_solve functions cannot guarantee constant-time execution, potentially leaking information about secret polynomial coefficients. An attacker with the ability to make precise timing measurements of these operations could potentially extract secret information through statistical analysis of execution times, though practical exploitation would require significant expertise and controlled execution environments. Successful exploitation of these timing side-channels could allow an attacker to recover secret keys or other sensitive information protected by the VSS scheme. This could lead to a complete compromise of the shared secret. As of time of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing exist, but other mitigations are available. As acknowledged in the library's documentation, these vulnerabilities cannot be adequately addressed in pure Python. In the short term, consider using this library only in environments where timing measurements by attackers are infeasible. In the medium term, implement your own wrappers around critical operations using constant-time libraries in languages like Rust, Go, or C. In the long term, wait for the planned Rust implementation mentioned in the library documentation that will properly address these issues.",

Baremetal Operator enables users to load Secret from arbitrary namespaces upon deployment of the namespace scoped Custom Resource `BMCEventSubscription`. Prior to versions 0.8.1 and 0.9.1, an adversary Kubernetes account with only namespace level roles (e.g. a tenant controlling a namespace) may create a `BMCEventSubscription` in his authorized namespace and then load Secrets from his unauthorized namespaces to his authorized namespace via the Baremetal Operator, causing Secret Leakage. The patch makes BMO refuse to read Secrets from other namespace than where the corresponding BMH resource is. The patch does not change the `BMCEventSubscription` API in BMO, but stricter validation will fail the request at admission time. It will also prevent the controller reading such Secrets, in case the BMCES CR has already been deployed. The issue exists for all versions of BMO, and is patched in BMO releases v0.9.1 and v0.8.1. Prior upgrading to patched BMO version, duplicate any existing Secret pointed to by `BMCEventSubscription`'s `httpHeadersRef` to the same namespace where the corresponding BMH exists. After upgrade, remove the old Secrets. As a workaround, the operator can configure BMO RBAC to be namespace scoped, instead of cluster scoped, to prevent BMO from accessing Secrets from other namespaces, and/or use `WATCH_NAMESPACE` configuration option to limit BMO to single namespace.",

    "description": "Expr is an expression language and expression evaluation for Go. Prior to version 1.17.0, if the Expr expression parser is given an unbounded input string, it will attempt to compile the entire string and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node for each part of the expression. In scenarios where input size isn\u2019t limited, a malicious or inadvertent extremely large expression can consume excessive memory as the parser builds a huge AST. This can ultimately lead to*excessive memory usage and an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash of the process. This issue is relatively uncommon and will only manifest when there are no restrictions on the input size, i.e. the expression length is allowed to grow arbitrarily large. In typical use cases where inputs are bounded or validated, this problem would not occur. The problem has been patched in the latest versions of the Expr library. The fix introduces compile-time limits on the number of AST nodes and memory usage during parsing, preventing any single expression from exhausting resources. Users should upgrade to Expr version 1.17.0 or later, as this release includes the new node budget and memory limit safeguards. Upgrading to v1.17.0 ensures that extremely deep or large expressions are detected and safely aborted during compilation, avoiding the OOM condition. For users who cannot immediately upgrade, the recommended workaround is to impose an input size restriction before parsing. In practice, this means validating or limiting the length of expression strings that your application will accept.

    "description": "The Syliud PayPal Plugin is the Sylius Core Team\u2019s plugin for the PayPal Commerce Platform. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.6.1, 1.7.1, and 2.0.1 allows users to manipulate the final payment amount processed by PayPal. If a user modifies the item quantity in their shopping cart after initiating the PayPal Express Checkout process, PayPal will not receive the updated total amount. As a result, PayPal captures only the initially transmitted amount, while Sylius incorrectly considers the order fully paid based on the modified total. This flaw can be exploited both accidentally and intentionally, potentially enabling fraud by allowing customers to pay less than the actual order value. Attackers can intentionally pay less than the actual total order amount, business owners may suffer financial losses due to underpaid orders, and integrity of payment processing is compromised. The issue is fixed in versions 1.6.1, 1.7.1, 2.0.1, and above. To resolve the problem in the end application without updating to the newest patches, there is a need to overwrite `ProcessPayPalOrderAction`, `CompletePayPalOrderFromPaymentPageAction`, and `CaptureAction` with modified logic.",

Besu 24.7.1 through 25.2.2, corresponding to besu-native versions 0.9.0 through 1.2.1, have a potential consensus bug for the precompiles ALTBN128_ADD (0x06), ALTBN128_MUL (0x07), and ALTBN128_PAIRING (0x08). These precompiles were reimplemented in besu-native using gnark-crypto's bn254 implementation, as the former implementation used a library which was no longer maintained and not sufficiently performant. The new gnark implementation was initially added in version 0.9.0 of besu-native but was not utilized by Besu until version 0.9.2 in Besu 24.7.1. The issue is that there are EC points which may be crafted which are in the correct subgroup but are not on the curve and the besu-native gnark implementation was relying on subgroup checks to perform point-on-curve checks as well. The version of gnark-crypto used at the time did not do this check when performing subgroup checks. The result is that it was possible for Besu to give an incorrect result and fall out of consensus when executing one of these precompiles against a specially crafted input point. Additionally, homogenous Besu-only networks can potentially enshrine invalid state which would be incorrect and difficult to process with patched versions of besu which handle these calls correctly. The underlying defect has been patched in besu-native release 1.3.0. The fixed version of Besu is version 25.3.0. As a workaround for versions of Besu with the problem, the native precompile for altbn128 may be disabled in favor of the pure-java implementation. The pure java implementation is significantly slower, but does not have this consensus issue.",

In a multi-node vLLM deployment, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The primary vLLM host opens an XPUB ZeroMQ socket and binds it to ALL interfaces. While the socket is always opened for a multi-node deployment, it is only used when doing tensor parallelism across multiple hosts. Any client with network access to this host can connect to this XPUB socket unless its port is blocked by a firewall. Once connected, these arbitrary clients will receive all of the same data broadcasted to all of the secondary vLLM hosts. This data is internal vLLM state information that is not useful to an attacker. By potentially connecting to this socket many times and not reading data published to them, an attacker can also cause a denial of service by slowing down or potentially blocking the publisher.

Such setups are commonly only used during local development. Sites that use other server software (such as Apache, nginx or Caddy) are not affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the Kirby installation. The vulnerable implementation delegated all existing files to PHP, including existing files outside of the document root. This leads to a different response that allows attackers to determine whether the requested file exists. Because Kirby's router only delegates such requests to PHP and does not load or execute them, contents of the files were not exposed as PHP treats requests to files outside of the document root as invalid. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers of Kirby have updated the router to check if existing static files are within the document root. Requests to files outside the document root are treated as page requests of the error page and will no longer allow to determine whether the file exists or not.",

The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.",

Sites that only use fixed calls to the `collection()` helper/`$kirby->collection()` method (i.e. calls with a simple string for the collection name) are *not* affected. A missing path traversal check allowed attackers to navigate and access all files on the server that were accessible to the PHP process, including files outside of the collections root or even outside of the Kirby installation. PHP code within such files was executed. Such attacks first require an attack vector in the site code that is caused by dynamic collection names, such as `collection('tags-' . get('tags'))`. It generally also requires knowledge of the site structure and the server's file system by the attacker, although it can be possible to find vulnerable setups through automated methods such as fuzzing. In a vulnerable setup, this could cause damage to the confidentiality and integrity of the server. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.9.8.3, Kirby 3.10.1.2, and Kirby 4.7.1.

From 1.32.3 through 1.34.4, there is a use-after-free in read_answers() when process_answer() may re-enqueue a query either due to a DNS Cookie Failure or when the upstream server does not properly support EDNS, or possibly on TCP queries if the remote closed the connection immediately after a response. If there was an issue trying to put that new transaction on the wire, it would close the connection handle, but read_answers() was still expecting the connection handle to be available to possibly dequeue other responses. In theory a remote attacker might be able to trigger this by flooding the target with ICMP UNREACHABLE packets if they also control the upstream nameserver and can return a result with one of those conditions, this has been untested. Otherwise only a local attacker might be able to change system behavior to make send()/write() return a failure condition. This vulnerability is fixed in 1.34.5.",

    "description": "Jellyfin is an open source self hosted media server. Versions before 10.10.7 are vulnerable to argument injection in FFmpeg. This can be leveraged to possibly achieve remote code execution by anyone with credentials to a low-privileged user. This vulnerability was previously reported in CVE-2023-49096 and patched in version 10.8.13, but the patch can be bypassed. The original fix sanitizes some parameters to make injection impossible, but certain unsanitized parameters can still be used for argument injection. The same unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable: /Videos/<itemId>/stream and /Videos/<itemId>/stream.<container>, likely alongside similar endpoints in AudioController. This argument injection can be exploited to achieve arbitrary file write, leading to possible remote code execution through the plugin system. While the unauthenticated endpoints are vulnerable, a valid itemId is required for exploitation and any authenticated attacker could easily retrieve a valid itemId to make the exploit work. This vulnerability is patched in version 10.10.7.",

This endpoint is intended to be admins-only, but it also authorizes requests from any device in the same local network as the Jellyfin server. Due to the method Jellyfin uses to determine the source IP of a request, an unauthenticated attacker is able to spoof their IP to appear as a LAN IP, allowing them to restart the Jellyfin server process without authentication. This means that an unauthenticated attacker could mount a denial-of-service attack on any default-configured Jellyfin server by simply sending the same spoofed request every few seconds to restart the server over and over. This method of IP spoofing also bypasses some security mechanisms, cause a denial-of-service attack, and possible bypass the admin restart requirement if combined with remote code execution.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwifi: ath12k: Avoid memory leak while enabling statistics\n\nDriver uses monitor destination rings for extended statistics mode and\nstandalone monitor mode. In extended statistics mode, TLVs are parsed from\nthe buffer received from the monitor destination ring and assigned to the\nppdu_info structure to update per-packet statistics. In standalone monitor\nmode, along with per-packet statistics, the packet data (payload) is\ncaptured, and the driver updates per MSDU to mac80211.\n\nWhen the AP interface is enabled, only extended statistics mode is\nactivated. As part of enabling monitor rings for collecting statistics,\nthe driver subscribes to HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV in the filter\nconfiguration. This TLV is received from the monitor destination ring, and\nkzalloc for the mon_mpdu object occurs, which is not freed, leading to a\nmemory leak. The kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object is only required while\nenabling the standalone monitor interface. This causes a memory leak while\nenabling extended statistics mode in the driver.\n\nFix this memory leak by removing the kzalloc for the mon_mpdu object in\nthe HAL_RX_MPDU_START TLV handling. Additionally, remove the standalone\nmonitor mode handlings in the HAL_MON_BUF_ADDR and HAL_RX_MSDU_END TLVs.\nThese TLV tags will be handled properly when enabling standalone monitor\nmode in the future.\n\nTested-on: QCN9274 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.WBE.1.3.1-00173-QCAHKSWPL_SILICONZ-1\nTested-on: WCN7850 hw2.0 PCI WLAN.HMT.1.0.c5-00481-QCAHMTSWPL_V1.0_V2.0_SILICONZ-3",

However, the dst->rtable elements pointing to its ports,\nas created by dsa_link_touch(), will remain there, and will lead to\nuse-after-free if dereferenced.\n\nIf dsa_tree_setup_switches() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, which is entirely\npossible because that is where ds->ops->setup() is, we get a kasan\nreport like this:\n\n==================================================================\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in mv88e6xxx_setup_upstream_port+0x240/0x568\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff000004f56020 by task kworker/u8:3/42\n\nCall trace:\n __asan_report_load8_noabort+0x20/0x30\n mv88e6xxx_setup_upstream_port+0x240/0x568\n mv88e6xxx_setup+0xebc/0x1eb0\n dsa_register_switch+0x1af4/0x2ae0\n mv88e6xxx_register_switch+0x1b8/0x2a8\n mv88e6xxx_probe+0xc4c/0xf60\n mdio_probe+0x78/0xb8\n really_probe+0x2b8/0x5a8\n __driver_probe_device+0x164/0x298\n driver_probe_device+0x78/0x258\n __device_attach_driver+0x274/0x350\n\nAllocated by task 42:\n __kasan_kmalloc+0x84/0xa0\n __kmalloc_cache_noprof+0x298/0x490\n dsa_switch_touch_ports+0x174/0x3d8\n dsa_register_switch+0x800/0x2ae0\n mv88e6xxx_register_switch+0x1b8/0x2a8\n mv88e6xxx_probe+0xc4c/0xf60\n mdio_probe+0x78/0xb8\n really_probe+0x2b8/0x5a8\n __driver_probe_device+0x164/0x298\n driver_probe_device+0x78/0x258\n __device_attach_driver+0x274/0x350\n\nFreed by task 42:\n __kasan_slab_free+0x48/0x68\n kfree+0x138/0x418\n dsa_register_switch+0x2694/0x2ae0\n mv88e6xxx_register_switch+0x1b8/0x2a8\n mv88e6xxx_probe+0xc4c/0xf60\n mdio_probe+0x78/0xb8\n really_probe+0x2b8/0x5a8\n __driver_probe_device+0x164/0x298\n driver_probe_device+0x78/0x258\n __device_attach_driver+0x274/0x350\n\nThe simplest way to fix the bug is to delete the routing table in its\nentirety. dsa_tree_setup_routing_table() has no problem in regenerating\nit even if we deleted links between ports other than those of switch N,\nbecause dsa_link_touch() first checks whether the port pair already\nexists in dst->rtable, allocating if not.\n\nThe deletion of the routing table in its entirety already exists in\ndsa_tree_teardown(), so refactor that into a function that can also be\ncalled from the tree setup error path.\n\nIn my analysis of the commit to blame, it is the one which added\ndsa_link elements to dst->rtable.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvmxnet3: Fix malformed packet sizing in vmxnet3_process_xdp\n\nvmxnet3 driver's XDP handling is buggy for packet sizes using ring0 (that\nis, packet sizes between 128 - 3k bytes).\n\nWe noticed MTU-related connectivity issues with Cilium's service load-\nbalancing in case of vmxnet3 as NIC underneath. A simple curl to a HTTP\nbackend service where the XDP LB was doing IPIP encap led to overly large\npacket sizes but only for *some* of the packets (e.g. HTTP GET request)\nwhile others (e.g. the prior TCP 3WHS) looked completely fine on the wire.\n\nIn fact, the pcap recording on the backend node actually revealed that the\nnode with the XDP LB was leaking uninitialized kernel data onto the wire\nfor the affected packets, for example, while the packets should have been\n152 bytes their actual size was 1482 bytes, so the remainder after 152 bytes\nwas padded with whatever other data was in that page at the time (e.g. we\nsaw user/payload data from prior processed packets).\n\nWe only noticed this through an MTU issue, e.g. when the XDP LB node and\nthe backend node both had the same MTU (e.g. 1500) then the curl request\ngot dropped on the backend node's NIC given the packet was too large even\nthough the IPIP-encapped packet normally would never even come close to\nthe MTU limit. Lowering the MTU on the XDP LB (e.g. 1480) allowed to let\nthe curl request succeed (which also indicates that the kernel ignored the\npadding, and thus the issue wasn't very user-visible).\n\nCommit e127ce7699c1 (\"vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom\") was too eager\nto also switch xdp_prepare_buff() from rcd->len to rbi->len. It really needs\nto stick to rcd->len which is the actual packet length from the descriptor.\nThe latter we also feed into vmxnet3_process_xdp_small(), by the way, and\nit indicates the correct length needed to initialize the xdp->{data,data_end}\nparts. For e127ce7699c1 (\"vmxnet3: Fix missing reserved tailroom\") the\nrelevant part was adapting xdp_init_buff() to address the warning given the\nxdp_data_hard_end() depends on xdp->frame_sz. With that fixed, traffic on\nthe wire looks good again.",

In mm/kmemleak.c, scan_block() scans the memory based\non 8 byte stride, so it won't detect above pptr, hence reporting the memory\nleak.\n\nIn htab_map_alloc(), we already have\n\n        htab->elem_size = sizeof(struct htab_elem) +\n                          round_up(htab->map.key_size, 8);\n        if (percpu)\n                htab->elem_size += sizeof(void *);\n        else\n                htab->elem_size += round_up(htab->map.value_size, 8);\n\nSo storing pptr with 8-byte alignment won't cause any problem and can fix\nkmemleak too.\n\nThe issue can be reproduced with bpf selftest as well:\n  1. Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK config\n  2. Add a getchar() before skel destroy in test_hash_map() in prog_tests/for_each.c.\n     The purpose is to keep map available so kmemleak can be detected.\n  3. run './test_progs -t for_each/hash_map &' and a kmemleak should be reported.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ntty: Require CAP_SYS_ADMIN for all usages of TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT\n\nThis requirement was overeagerly loosened in commit 2f83e38a095f\n(\"tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes without CAP_SYS_ADMIN\"), but as\nit turns out,\n\n  (1) the logic I implemented there was inconsistent (apologies!),\n\n  (2) TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT might actually be a small security risk\n      after all, and\n\n  (3) TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is only meant to be used by the mouse\n      daemon (GPM or Consolation), which runs as CAP_SYS_ADMIN\n      already.\n\nIn more detail:\n\n1. The previous patch has inconsistent logic:\n\n   In commit 2f83e38a095f (\"tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes\n   without CAP_SYS_ADMIN\"), we checked for sel_mode ==\n   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, but overlooked that the lower four bits of\n   this \"mode\" parameter were actually used as an additional way to\n   pass an argument.  So the patch did actually still require\n   CAP_SYS_ADMIN, if any of the mouse button bits are set, but did not\n   require it if none of the mouse buttons bits are set.\n\n   This logic is inconsistent and was not intentional.  We should have\n   the same policies for using TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT independent of the\n   value of the \"hidden\" mouse button argument.\n\n   I sent a separate documentation patch to the man page list with\n   more details on TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT:\n   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250223091342.35523-2-gnoack3000@gmail.com/\n\n2. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is indeed a potential security risk which can\n   let an attacker simulate \"keyboard\" input to command line\n   applications on the same terminal, like TIOCSTI and some other\n   TIOCLINUX \"selection mode\" IOCTLs.\n\n   By enabling mouse reporting on a terminal and then injecting mouse\n   reports through TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, an attacker can simulate\n   mouse movements on the same terminal, similar to the TIOCSTI\n   keystroke injection attacks that were previously possible with\n   TIOCSTI and other TIOCL_SETSEL selection modes.\n\n   Many programs (including libreadline/bash) are then prone to\n   misinterpret these mouse reports as normal keyboard input because\n   they do not expect input in the X11 mouse protocol form.  The\n   attacker does not have complete control over the escape sequence,\n   but they can at least control the values of two consecutive bytes\n   in the binary mouse reporting escape sequence.\n\n   I went into more detail on that in the discussion at\n   https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250221.0a947528d8f3@gnoack.org/\n\n   It is not equally trivial to simulate arbitrary keystrokes as it\n   was with TIOCSTI (commit 83efeeeb3d04 (\"tty: Allow TIOCSTI to be\n   disabled\")), but the general mechanism is there, and together with\n   the small number of existing legit use cases (see below), it would\n   be better to revert back to requiring CAP_SYS_ADMIN for\n   TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT, as it was already the case before\n   commit 2f83e38a095f (\"tty: Permit some TIOCL_SETSEL modes without\n   CAP_SYS_ADMIN\").\n\n3. TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT is only used by the mouse daemons (GPM or\n   Consolation), and they are the only legit use case:\n\n   To quote console_codes(4):\n\n     The mouse tracking facility is intended to return\n     xterm(1)-compatible mouse status reports.  Because the console\n     driver has no way to know the device or type of the mouse, these\n     reports are returned in the console input stream only when the\n     virtual terminal driver receives a mouse update ioctl.  These\n     ioctls must be generated by a mouse-aware user-mode application\n     such as the gpm(8) daemon.\n\n   Jared Finder has also confirmed in\n   https://lore.kernel.org/all/491f3df9de6593df8e70dbe77614b026@finder.org/\n   that Emacs does not call TIOCL_SELMOUSEREPORT directly, and it\n   would be difficult to find good reasons for doing that, given that\n   it would interfere with the reports that GPM is sending.\n\n   More information on the interaction between GPM, terminals and th\n---truncated---",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nsched/eevdf: Fix se->slice being set to U64_MAX and resulting crash\n\nThere is a code path in dequeue_entities() that can set the slice of a\nsched_entity to U64_MAX, which sometimes results in a crash.\n\nThe offending case is when dequeue_entities() is called to dequeue a\ndelayed group entity, and then the entity's parent's dequeue is delayed.\nIn that case:\n\n1. In the if (entity_is_task(se)) else block at the beginning of\n   dequeue_entities(), slice is set to\n   cfs_rq_min_slice(group_cfs_rq(se)). If the entity was delayed, then\n   it has no queued tasks, so cfs_rq_min_slice() returns U64_MAX.\n2. The first for_each_sched_entity() loop dequeues the entity.\n3. If the entity was its parent's only child, then the next iteration\n   tries to dequeue the parent.\n4. If the parent's dequeue needs to be delayed, then it breaks from the\n   first for_each_sched_entity() loop _without updating slice_.\n5. The second for_each_sched_entity() loop sets the parent's ->slice to\n   the saved slice, which is still U64_MAX.\n\nThis throws off subsequent calculations with potentially catastrophic\nresults. A manifestation we saw in production was:\n\n6. In update_entity_lag(), se->slice is used to calculate limit, which\n   ends up as a huge negative number.\n7. limit is used in se->vlag = clamp(vlag, -limit, limit). Because limit\n   is negative, vlag > limit, so se->vlag is set to the same huge\n   negative number.\n8. In place_entity(), se->vlag is scaled, which overflows and results in\n   another huge (positive or negative) number.\n9. The adjusted lag is subtracted from se->vruntime, which increases or\n   decreases se->vruntime by a huge number.\n10. pick_eevdf() calls entity_eligible()/vruntime_eligible(), which\n    incorrectly returns false because the vruntime is so far from the\n    other vruntimes on the queue, causing the\n    (vruntime - cfs_rq->min_vruntime) * load calulation to overflow.\n11. Nothing appears to be eligible, so pick_eevdf() returns NULL.\n12. pick_next_entity() tries to dereference the return value of\n    pick_eevdf() and crashes.\n\nDumping the cfs_rq states from the core dumps with drgn showed tell-tale\nhuge vruntime ranges and bogus vlag values, and I also traced se->slice\nbeing set to U64_MAX on live systems (which was usually \"benign\" since\nthe rest of the runqueue needed to be in a particular state to crash).\n\nFix it in dequeue_entities() by always setting slice from the first\nnon-empty cfs_rq.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nPCI: pciehp: Avoid unnecessary device replacement check\n\nHot-removal of nested PCI hotplug ports suffers from a long-standing race\ncondition which can lead to a deadlock:  A parent hotplug port acquires\npci_lock_rescan_remove(), then waits for pciehp to unbind from a child\nhotplug port.  Meanwhile that child hotplug port tries to acquire\npci_lock_rescan_remove() as well in order to remove its own children.\n\nThe deadlock only occurs if the parent acquires pci_lock_rescan_remove()\nfirst, not if the child happens to acquire it first.\n\nSeveral workarounds to avoid the issue have been proposed and discarded\nover the years, e.g.:\n\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/r/4c882e25194ba8282b78fe963fec8faae7cf23eb.1529173804.git.lukas@wunner.de/\n\nA proper fix is being worked on, but needs more time as it is nontrivial\nand necessarily intrusive.\n\nRecent commit 9d573d19547b (\"PCI: pciehp: Detect device replacement during\nsystem sleep\") provokes more frequent occurrence of the deadlock when\nremoving more than one Thunderbolt device during system sleep.  The commit\nsought to detect device replacement, but also triggered on device removal.\nDifferentiating reliably between replacement and removal is impossible\nbecause pci_get_dsn() returns 0 both if the device was removed, as well as\nif it was replaced with one lacking a Device Serial Number.\n\nAvoid the more frequent occurrence of the deadlock by checking whether the\nhotplug port itself was hot-removed.  If so, there's no sense in checking\nwhether its child device was replaced.\n\nThis works because the ->resume_noirq() callback is invoked in top-down\norder for the entire hierarchy:  A parent hotplug port detecting device\nreplacement (or removal) marks all children as removed using\npci_dev_set_disconnected() and a child hotplug port can then reliably\ndetect being removed.",

Later, an early\nvalidity check for child_event was added before the\nrefcount/assignment. Even later, a WARN_ON_ONCE() cleanup check was\nadded, assuming event->ctx is valid if the pmu_ctx is valid.\nThe problem is that the WARN_ON_ONCE() could trigger after the initial\ncheck passed but before child_event->ctx was assigned, violating its\nprecondition. The solution is to assign child_event->ctx right after\nits initial validation. This ensures the context exists for any\nsubsequent checks or cleanup routines, resolving the WARN_ON_ONCE().\n\nTo resolve it, defer the refcount update and child_event->ctx assignment\ndirectly after child_event->pmu_ctx is set but before checking if the\nparent event is orphaned.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: adjust subpage bit start based on sectorsize\n\nWhen running machines with 64k page size and a 16k nodesize we started\nseeing tree log corruption in production.  This turned out to be because\nwe were not writing out dirty blocks sometimes, so this in fact affects\nall metadata writes.\n\nWhen writing out a subpage EB we scan the subpage bitmap for a dirty\nrange.  If the range isn't dirty we do\n\n\tbit_start++;\n\nto move onto the next bit.  The problem is the bitmap is based on the\nnumber of sectors that an EB has.  So in this case, we have a 64k\npagesize, 16k nodesize, but a 4k sectorsize.  This means our bitmap is 4\nbits for every node.  With a 64k page size we end up with 4 nodes per\npage.\n\nTo make this easier this is how everything looks\n\n[0         16k       32k       48k     ] logical address\n[0         4         8         12      ] radix tree offset\n[               64k page               ] folio\n[ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ][ 16k eb ] extent buffers\n[ | | | |  | | | |   | | | |   | | | | ] bitmap\n\nNow we use all of our addressing based on fs_info->sectorsize_bits, so\nas you can see the above our 16k eb->start turns into radix entry 4.\n\nWhen we find a dirty range for our eb, we correctly do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, because if we start at bit 0, the next bit for the\nnext eb is 4, to correspond to eb->start 16k.\n\nHowever if our range is clean, we will do bit_start++, which will now\nput us offset from our radix tree entries.\n\nIn our case, assume that the first time we check the bitmap the block is\nnot dirty, we increment bit_start so now it == 1, and then we loop\naround and check again.  This time it is dirty, and we go to find that\nstart using the following equation\n\n\tstart = folio_start + bit_start * fs_info->sectorsize;\n\nso in the case above, eb->start 0 is now dirty, and we calculate start\nas\n\n\t0 + 1 * fs_info->sectorsize = 4096\n\t4096 >> 12 = 1\n\nNow we're looking up the radix tree for 1, and we won't find an eb.\nWhat's worse is now we're using bit_start == 1, so we do bit_start +=\nsectors_per_node, which is now 5.  If that eb is dirty we will run into\nthe same thing, we will look at an offset that is not populated in the\nradix tree, and now we're skipping the writeout of dirty extent buffers.\n\nThe best fix for this is to not use sectorsize_bits to address nodes,\nbut that's a larger change.  Since this is a fs corruption problem fix\nit simply by always using sectors_per_node to increment the start bit.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/x86/intel: KVM: Mask PEBS_ENABLE loaded for guest with vCPU's value.\n\nWhen generating the MSR_IA32_PEBS_ENABLE value that will be loaded on\nVM-Entry to a KVM guest, mask the value with the vCPU's desired PEBS_ENABLE\nvalue.  Consulting only the host kernel's host vs. guest masks results in\nrunning the guest with PEBS enabled even when the guest doesn't want to use\nPEBS.  Because KVM uses perf events to proxy the guest virtual PMU, simply\nlooking at exclude_host can't differentiate between events created by host\nuserspace, and events created by KVM on behalf of the guest.\n\nRunning the guest with PEBS unexpectedly enabled typically manifests as\ncrashes due to a near-infinite stream of #PFs.  E.g. if the guest hasn't\nwritten MSR_IA32_DS_AREA, the CPU will hit page faults on address '0' when\ntrying to record PEBS events.\n\nThe issue is most easily reproduced by running `perf kvm top` from before\ncommit 7b100989b4f6 (\"perf evlist: Remove __evlist__add_default\") (after\nwhich, `perf kvm top` effectively stopped using PEBS).\tThe userspace side\nof perf creates a guest-only PEBS event, which intel_guest_get_msrs()\nmisconstrues a guest-*owned* PEBS event.\n\nArguably, this is a userspace bug, as enabling PEBS on guest-only events\nsimply cannot work, and userspace can kill VMs in many other ways (there\nis no danger to the host).  However, even if this is considered to be bad\nuserspace behavior, there's zero downside to perf/KVM restricting PEBS to\nguest-owned events.\n\nNote, commit 854250329c02 (\"KVM: x86/pmu: Disable guest PEBS temporarily\nin two rare situations\") fixed the case where host userspace is profiling\nKVM *and* userspace, but missed the case where userspace is profiling only\nKVM.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: phy: allow MDIO bus PM ops to start/stop state machine for phylink-controlled PHY\n\nDSA has 2 kinds of drivers:\n\n1. Those who call dsa_switch_suspend() and dsa_switch_resume() from\n   their device PM ops: qca8k-8xxx, bcm_sf2, microchip ksz\n2. Those who don't: all others. The above methods should be optional.\n\nFor type 1, dsa_switch_suspend() calls dsa_user_suspend() -> phylink_stop(),\nand dsa_switch_resume() calls dsa_user_resume() -> phylink_start().\nThese seem good candidates for setting mac_managed_pm = true because\nthat is essentially its definition [1], but that does not seem to be the\nbiggest problem for now, and is not what this change focuses on.\n\nTalking strictly about the 2nd category of DSA drivers here (which\ndo not have MAC managed PM, meaning that for their attached PHYs,\nmdio_bus_phy_suspend() and mdio_bus_phy_resume() should run in full),\nI have noticed that the following warning from mdio_bus_phy_resume() is\ntriggered:\n\n\tWARN_ON(phydev->state != PHY_HALTED && phydev->state != PHY_READY &&\n\t\tphydev->state != PHY_UP);\n\nbecause the PHY state machine is running.\n\nIt's running as a result of a previous dsa_user_open() -> ... ->\nphylink_start() -> phy_start() having been initiated by the user.\n\nThe previous mdio_bus_phy_suspend() was supposed to have called\nphy_stop_machine(), but it didn't. So this is why the PHY is in state\nPHY_NOLINK by the time mdio_bus_phy_resume() runs.\n\nmdio_bus_phy_suspend() did not call phy_stop_machine() because for\nphylink, the phydev->adjust_link function pointer is NULL. This seems a\ntechnicality introduced by commit fddd91016d16 (\"phylib: fix PAL state\nmachine restart on resume\"). That commit was written before phylink\nexisted, and was intended to avoid crashing with consumer drivers which\ndon't use the PHY state machine - phylink always does, when using a PHY.\nBut phylink itself has historically not been developed with\nsuspend/resume in mind, and apparently not tested too much in that\nscenario, allowing this bug to exist unnoticed for so long. Plus, prior\nto the WARN_ON(), it would have likely been invisible.\n\nThis issue is not in fact restricted to type 2 DSA drivers (according to\nthe above ad-hoc classification), but can be extrapolated to any MAC\ndriver with phylink and MDIO-bus-managed PHY PM ops. DSA is just where\nthe issue was reported. Assuming mac_managed_pm is set correctly, a\nquick search indicates the following other drivers might be affected:\n\n$ grep -Zlr PHYLINK_NETDEV drivers/ | xargs -0 grep -L mac_managed_pm\ndrivers/net/ethernet/atheros/ag71xx.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/microchip/sparx5/sparx5_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/microchip/lan966x/lan966x_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/dpaa2/dpaa2-mac.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/fs_enet/fs_enet-main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/dpaa/dpaa_eth.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/ucc_geth.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/freescale/enetc/enetc_pf_common.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvpp2/mvpp2_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/marvell/mvneta.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/marvell/prestera/prestera_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/mediatek/mtk_eth_soc.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/altera/altera_tse_main.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/wangxun/txgbe/txgbe_phy.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/meta/fbnic/fbnic_phylink.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/tehuti/tn40_phy.c\ndrivers/net/ethernet/mscc/ocelot_net.c\n\nMake the existing conditions dependent on the PHY device having a\nphydev->phy_link_change() implementation equal to the default\nphy_link_change() provided by phylib. Otherwise, we implicitly know that\nthe phydev has the phylink-provided phylink_phy_change() callback, and\nwhen phylink is used, the PHY state machine always needs to be stopped/\nstarted on the suspend/resume path. The code is structured as such that\nif phydev->phy_link_change() is absent, it is a matter of time until the\nkernel will crash - no need to further complicate the test.\n\nThus, for the situation where the PM is not managed b\n---truncated---",

However, the commit\ndid not handle the analogous situation for System Management Mode (SMM).\n\nThis omission results in triggering a WARN when KVM forces a vCPU INIT\nafter SHUTDOWN interception while the vCPU is in SMM.

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mm: Eliminate window where TLB flushes may be inadvertently skipped\n\ntl;dr: There is a window in the mm switching code where the new CR3 is\nset and the CPU should be getting TLB flushes for the new mm.  But\nshould_flush_tlb() has a bug and suppresses the flush.  Fix it by\nwidening the window where should_flush_tlb() sends an IPI.\n\nLong Version:\n\n=== History ===\n\nThere were a few things leading up to this.\n\nFirst, updating mm_cpumask() was observed to be too expensive, so it was\nmade lazier.  But being lazy caused too many unnecessary IPIs to CPUs\ndue to the now-lazy mm_cpumask().  So code was added to cull\nmm_cpumask() periodically[2].  But that culling was a bit too aggressive\nand skipped sending TLB flushes to CPUs that need them.  So here we are\nagain.\n\n=== Problem ===\n\nThe too-aggressive code in should_flush_tlb() strikes in this window:\n\n\t// Turn on IPIs for this CPU/mm combination, but only\n\t// if should_flush_tlb() agrees:\n\tcpumask_set_cpu(cpu, mm_cpumask(next));\n\n\tnext_tlb_gen = atomic64_read(&next->context.tlb_gen);\n\tchoose_new_asid(next, next_tlb_gen, &new_asid, &need_flush);\n\tload_new_mm_cr3(need_flush);\n\t// ^ After 'need_flush' is set to false, IPIs *MUST*\n\t// be sent to this CPU and not be ignored.\n\n        this_cpu_write(cpu_tlbstate.loaded_mm, next);\n\t// ^ Not until this point does should_flush_tlb()\n\t// become true!\n\nshould_flush_tlb() will suppress TLB flushes between load_new_mm_cr3()\nand writing to 'loaded_mm', which is a window where they should not be\nsuppressed.  Whoops.\n\n=== Solution ===\n\nThankfully, the fuzzy \"just about to write CR3\" window is already marked\nwith loaded_mm==LOADED_MM_SWITCHING.  Simply checking for that state in\nshould_flush_tlb() is sufficient to ensure that the CPU is targeted with\nan IPI.\n\nThis will cause more TLB flush IPIs.  But the window is relatively small\nand I do not expect this to cause any kind of measurable performance\nimpact.\n\nUpdate the comment where LOADED_MM_SWITCHING is written since it grew\nyet another user.\n\nPeter Z also raised a concern that should_flush_tlb() might not observe\n'loaded_mm' and 'is_lazy' in the same order that switch_mm_irqs_off()\nwrites them.  Add a barrier to ensure that they are observed in the\norder they are written.",

The rules are\n\t* mount_lock stabilizes m->mnt_parent for any mount m.\n\t* namespace_sem stabilizes m->mnt_parent, provided that\nm is mounted.\n\t* if either of the above holds and refcount of m is positive,\nwe are guaranteed the same for refcount of m->mnt_parent.\n\nnamespace_sem nests inside inode_lock(), so do_lock_mount() has\nto take inode_lock() before grabbing namespace_sem.  It does\nrecheck that path->mnt is still mounted in the same place after\ngetting namespace_sem, and it does take care to pin the dentry.\nIt is needed, since otherwise we might end up with racing mount --move\n(or umount) happening while we were getting locks; in that case\ndentry would no longer be a mountpoint and could've been evicted\non memory pressure along with its inode - not something you want\nwhen grabbing lock on that inode.\n\nHowever, pinning a dentry is not enough - the matching mount is\nalso pinned only by the fact that path->mnt is mounted on top it\nand at that point we are not holding any locks whatsoever, so\nthe same kind of races could end up with all references to\nthat mount gone just as we are about to enter inode_lock().\nIf that happens, we are left with filesystem being shut down while\nwe are holding a dentry reference on it; results are not pretty.\n\nWhat we need to do is grab both dentry and mount at the same time;\nthat makes inode_lock() safe *and* avoids the problem with fs getting\nshut down under us.  After taking namespace_sem we verify that\npath->mnt is still mounted (which stabilizes its ->mnt_parent) and\ncheck that it's still mounted at the same place.  From that point\non to the matching namespace_unlock() we are guaranteed that\nmount/dentry pair we'd grabbed are also pinned by being the mountpoint\nof path->mnt, so we can quietly drop both the dentry reference (as\nthe current code does) and mnt one - it's OK to do under namespace_sem,\nsince we are not dropping the final refs.\n\nThat solves the problem on do_lock_mount() side; unlock_mount()\nalso has one, since dentry is guaranteed to stay pinned only until\nthe namespace_unlock().

As a result of lazy binding, we hit a floating-point\nstore in fpe_func almost immediately.\n\nWhen the T bit is set, an assist exception trap occurs when when the\nco-processor encounters *any* floating-point instruction except for a double\nstore of register %fr0.  The latter cancels all pending traps.  Let's fix this\nby clearing the Trap (T) bit in the FP status register before returning to the\nsignal handler in userspace.\n\nThe issue can be reproduced with this test program:\n\nroot@parisc:~# cat fpe.c\n\nstatic void fpe_func(int sig, siginfo_t *i, void *v) {\n        sigset_t set;\n        sigemptyset(&set);\n        sigaddset(&set, SIGFPE);\n        sigprocmask(SIG_UNBLOCK, &set, NULL);\n        printf(\"GOT signal %d with si_code %ld\\n\", sig, i->si_code);\n}\n\nint main() {\n        struct sigaction action = {\n                .sa_sigaction = fpe_func,\n                .sa_flags = SA_RESTART|SA_SIGINFO };\n        sigaction(SIGFPE, &action, 0);\n        feenableexcept(FE_OVERFLOW);\n        return printf(\"%lf\\n\",1.7976931348623158E308*1.7976931348623158E308);\n}\n\nroot@parisc:~# gcc fpe.c -lm\nroot@parisc:~# ./a.out\n Floating point exception\n\nroot@parisc:~# strace -f ./a.out\n execve(\"./a.out\", [\"./a.out\"], 0xf9ac7034 /* 20 vars */) = 0\n getrlimit(RLIMIT_STACK, {rlim_cur=8192*1024, rlim_max=RLIM_INFINITY}) = 0\n ...\n rt_sigaction(SIGFPE, {sa_handler=0x1110a, sa_mask=[], sa_flags=SA_RESTART|SA_SIGINFO}, NULL, 8) = 0\n --- SIGFPE {si_signo=SIGFPE, si_code=FPE_FLTOVF, si_addr=0x1078f} ---\n --- SIGFPE {si_signo=SIGFPE, si_code=FPE_FLTOVF, si_addr=0xf8f21237} ---\n +++ killed by SIGFPE +++\n Floating point exception",

Then it retries the bio_add_folio() call.\n\nHowever, at this point, erofs_onlinefolio_split() has already been\ncalled which increments `folio->private`; the retry will call\nerofs_onlinefolio_split() again, but there will never be a matching\nerofs_onlinefolio_end() call.

If not, it logs\n\"ea_get: invalid extended attribute\" and calls print_hex_dump().\n\nHere, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr) returns 4110417968, which exceeds\nINT_MAX (2,147,483,647). Then ea_size is clamped:\n\n\tint size = clamp_t(int, ea_size, 0, EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr));\n\nAlthough clamp_t aims to bound ea_size between 0 and 4110417968, the upper\nlimit is treated as an int, causing an overflow above 2^31 - 1. This leads\n\"size\" to wrap around and become negative (-184549328).\n\nThe \"size\" is then passed to print_hex_dump() (called \"len\" in\nprint_hex_dump()), it is passed as type size_t (an unsigned\ntype), this is then stored inside a variable called\n\"int remaining\", which is then assigned to \"int linelen\" which\nis then passed to hex_dump_to_buffer(). In print_hex_dump()\nthe for loop, iterates through 0 to len-1, where len is\n18446744073525002176, calling hex_dump_to_buffer()\non each iteration:\n\n\tfor (i = 0; i < len; i += rowsize) {\n\t\tlinelen = min(remaining, rowsize);\n\t\tremaining -= rowsize;\n\n\t\thex_dump_to_buffer(ptr + i, linelen, rowsize, groupsize,\n\t\t\t\t   linebuf, sizeof(linebuf), ascii);\n\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\nThe expected stopping condition (i < len) is effectively broken\nsince len is corrupted and very large. This eventually leads to\nthe \"ptr+i\" being passed to hex_dump_to_buffer() to get closer\nto the end of the actual bounds of \"ptr\", eventually an out of\nbounds access is done in hex_dump_to_buffer() in the following\nfor loop:\n\n\tfor (j = 0; j < len; j++) {\n\t\t\tif (linebuflen < lx + 2)\n\t\t\t\tgoto overflow2;\n\t\t\tch = ptr[j];\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\nTo fix this we should validate \"EALIST_SIZE(ea_buf->xattr)\"\nbefore it is utilised.",

    "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/mce: use is_copy_from_user() to determine copy-from-user context\n\nPatch series \"mm/hwpoison: Fix regressions in memory failure handling\",\nv4.\n\n## 1. What am I trying to do:\n\nThis patchset resolves two critical regressions related to memory failure\nhandling that have appeared in the upstream kernel since version 5.17, as\ncompared to 5.10 LTS.\n\n    - copyin case: poison found in user page while kernel copying from user space\n    - instr case: poison found while instruction fetching in user space\n\n## 2. What is the expected outcome and why\n\n- For copyin case:\n\nKernel can recover from poison found where kernel is doing get_user() or\ncopy_from_user() if those places get an error return and the kernel return\n-EFAULT to the process instead of crashing.  More specifily, MCE handler\nchecks the fixup handler type to decide whether an in kernel #MC can be\nrecovered.  When EX_TYPE_UACCESS is found, the PC jumps to recovery code\nspecified in _ASM_EXTABLE_FAULT() and return a -EFAULT to user space.\n\n- For instr case:\n\nIf a poison found while instruction fetching in user space, full recovery\nis possible.  User process takes #PF, Linux allocates a new page and fills\nby reading from storage.\n\n\n## 3. What actually happens and why\n\n- For copyin case: kernel panic since v5.17\n\nCommit 4c132d1d844a (\"x86/futex: Remove .fixup usage\") introduced a new\nextable fixup type, EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG, and later patches updated the\nextable fixup type for copy-from-user operations, changing it from\nEX_TYPE_UACCESS to EX_TYPE_EFAULT_REG.  It breaks previous EX_TYPE_UACCESS\nhandling when posion found in get_user() or copy_from_user().\n\n- For instr case: user process is killed by a SIGBUS signal due to #CMCI\n  and #MCE race\n\nWhen an uncorrected memory error is consumed there is a race between the\nCMCI from the memory controller reporting an uncorrected error with a UCNA\nsignature, and the core reporting and SRAR signature machine check when\nthe data is about to be consumed.\n\n### Background: why *UN*corrected errors tied to *C*MCI in Intel platform [1]\n\nPrior to Icelake memory controllers reported patrol scrub events that\ndetected a previously unseen uncorrected error in memory by signaling a\nbroadcast machine check with an SRAO (Software Recoverable Action\nOptional) signature in the machine check bank.  This was overkill because\nit's not an urgent problem that no core is on the verge of consuming that\nbad data.  It's also found that multi SRAO UCE may cause nested MCE\ninterrupts and finally become an IERR.\n\nHence, Intel downgrades the machine check bank signature of patrol scrub\nfrom SRAO to UCNA (Uncorrected, No Action required), and signal changed to\n#CMCI.  Just to add to the confusion, Linux does take an action (in\nuc_decode_notifier()) to try to offline the page despite the UC*NA*\nsignature name.\n\n### Background: why #CMCI and #MCE race when poison is consuming in\n    Intel platform [1]\n\nHaving decided that CMCI/UCNA is the best action for patrol scrub errors,\nthe memory controller uses it for reads too.  But the memory controller is\nexecuting asynchronously from the core, and can't tell the difference\nbetween a \"real\" read and a speculative read.  So it will do CMCI/UCNA if\nan error is found in any read.\n\nThus:\n\n1) Core is clever and thinks address A is needed soon, issues a\n   speculative read.\n\n2) Core finds it is going to use address A soon after sending the read\n   request\n\n3) The CMCI from the memory controller is in a race with MCE from the\n   core that will soon try to retire the load from address A.\n\nQuite often (because speculation has got better) the CMCI from the memory\ncontroller is delivered before the core is committed to the instruction\nreading address A, so the interrupt is taken, and Linux offlines the page\n(marking it as poison).\n\n\n## Why user process is killed for instr case\n\nCommit 046545a661af (\"mm/hwpoison: fix error page recovered but reported\n\"not\n---truncated---",

The authorization flow is not implemented by workers-oauth-provider; it is up to the application built on top to decide whether to implement such automatic re-authorization. However, many applications do implement such logic.\n\nNote: It is a basic, well-known requirement that OAuth servers should verify that the redirect URI is among the allowed list for the client, both during the authorization flow and subsequently when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. workers-oauth-provider implemented only the latter check, not the former. Unfortunately, the former is the much more important check.\u00a0Readers who are familiar with OAuth may recognize that failing to check redirect URIs against the allowed list is a well-known, basic mistake, covered extensively in the RFC and elsewhere. The author of this library would like everyone to know that he was, in fact, well-aware of this requirement, thought about it a lot while designing the library, and then, somehow, forgot to actually make sure the check was in the code.

Starting in version 12.0.0 and prior to version 2025.4.1, due to an oversight in the validation performed in `UrlPreviewService` and `MkUrlPreview`, it is possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary CSS into the `MkUrlPreview` component. `UrlPreviewService.wrap` falls back to returning the original URL if it's using a protocol that is likely to not be understood by Misskey, IE something other than `http` or `https`. This both can de-anonymize users and_allow further attacks in the client. Additionally, `MkUrlPreview` doesn't escape CSS when applying a `background-image` property, allowing an attacker to craft a URL that applies arbitrary styles to the preview element. Theoretically, an attacker can craft a CSS injection payload to create a fake error message that can deceive the user into giving away their credentials or similar sensitive information. Version 2025.4.1 contains a patch for the issue.",

Specifically, when a mutation includes a `where` clause with multiple unique filters (e.g. `id` and `email`), Keystone will attempt to match records even if filtering by the latter fields would normally be rejected by `field.isFilterable` or `list.defaultIsFilterable`. This can allow malicious actors to infer the presence of a particular field value when a filter is successful in returning a result. This affects any project relying on the default or dynamic `isFilterable` behavior (at the list or field level) to prevent external users from using the filtering of fields as a discovery mechanism. While this access control is respected during `findMany` operations, it was not completely enforced during `update` and `delete` mutations when accepting more than one unique `where` values in filters. This has no impact on projects using `isFilterable: false` or `defaultIsFilterable: false` for sensitive fields, or for those who have otherwise omitted filtering by these fields from their GraphQL schema. This issue has been patched in `@keystone-6/core` version 6.5.0. To mitigate this issue in older versions where patching is not a viable pathway, set `isFilterable: false` statically for relevant fields to prevent filtering by them earlier in the access control pipeline (that is, don't use functions); set `{field}.graphql.omit.read: true` for relevant fields, which implicitly removes filtering by these fields from the GraphQL schema; and/or deny `update` and `delete` operations for the relevant lists completely.",

    "description": "nosurf is cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection middleware for Go. A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.2.0 allows an attacker who controls content on the target site, or on a subdomain of the target site (either via XSS, or otherwise) to bypass CSRF checks and issue requests on user's behalf. Due to misuse of the Go `net/http` library, nosurf categorizes all incoming requests as plain-text HTTP requests, in which case the `Referer` header is not checked to have the same origin as the target webpage. If the attacker has control over HTML contents on either the target website (e.g. `example.com`), or on a website hosted on a subdomain of the target (e.g. `attacker.example.com`), they will also be able to manipulate cookies set for the target website. By acquiring the secret CSRF token from the cookie, or overriding the cookie with a new token known to the attacker, `attacker.example.com` is able to craft cross-site requests to `example.com`. A patch for the issue was released in nosurf 1.2.0. In lieu of upgrading to a patched version of nosurf, users may additionally use another HTTP middleware to ensure that a non-safe HTTP request is coming from the same origin (e.g. by requiring a `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` header in the request).",

    "description": "Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14, `Rack::QueryParser` parses query strings and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies into Ruby data structures without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters. The vulnerability arises because `Rack::QueryParser` iterates over each `&`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies.

This leads to potential exhaustion of system memory and results in a server crash or unresponsiveness. Version 0.20.1 fixes the issue by enforcing limits during parsing. If the limit is exceeded at any point during reading, the connection is terminated immediately. A short-term workaround through a Reverse Proxy is available. If updating the library immediately is not feasible, deploy a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) in front of the `cpp-httplib` application.

    "description": "MobSF is a mobile application security testing tool used. Typically, MobSF is deployed on centralized internal or cloud-based servers that also host other security tools and web applications. Access to the MobSF web interface is often granted to internal security teams, audit teams, and external vendors.  MobSF provides a feature that allows users to upload ZIP files for static analysis. Upon upload, these ZIP files are automatically extracted and stored within the MobSF directory. However, in versions up to and including 4.3.2, this functionality lacks a check on the total uncompressed size of the ZIP file, making it vulnerable to a ZIP of Death (zip bomb) attack. Due to the absence of safeguards against oversized extractions, an attacker can craft a specially prepared ZIP file that is small in compressed form but expands to a massive size upon extraction. Exploiting this, an attacker can exhaust the server's disk space, leading to a complete denial of service (DoS) not just for MobSF, but also for any other applications or websites hosted on the same server. This vulnerability can lead to complete server disruption in an organization which can affect other internal portals and tools too (which are hosted on the same server). If some organization has created their customized cloud based mobile security tool using MobSF core then an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash their servers. Commit 6987a946485a795f4fd38cebdb4860b368a1995d fixes this issue. As an additional mitigation, it is recommended to implement a safeguard that checks the total uncompressed size of any uploaded ZIP file before extraction.

Since this length is a `u32`, a peer can trigger allocations of up to 4 GB, potentially leading to memory exhaustion and node crashes. As Discovery messages are regularly exchanged for peer discovery, this vulnerability can be exploited repeatedly. The patch for this vulnerability is formally released as part of v1.1.0.

All users on the Rallly applications are impacted. As long as an attacker knows the user's email address they used to register on the app, they can systematically take over any user account. For the authentication mechanism to be safe, the token would need to be assigned a complex high entropy value that cannot be bruteforced within reasonable time, and ideally rate limiting the /api/auth/callback/email endpoint to further make brute force attempts unreasonable within the 15 minutes time.

    "description": "OpenPGP.js is a JavaScript implementation of the OpenPGP protocol. Startinf in version 5.0.1 and prior to versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1, a maliciously modified message can be passed to either `openpgp.verify` or `openpgp.decrypt`, causing these functions to return a valid signature verification result while returning data that was not actually signed. This flaw allows signature verifications of inline (non-detached) signed messages (using `openpgp.verify`) and signed-and-encrypted messages (using `openpgp.decrypt` with `verificationKeys`) to be spoofed, since both functions return extracted data that may not match the data that was originally signed. Detached signature verifications are not affected, as no signed data is returned in that case. In order to spoof a message, the attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker's choice, which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js. In other words, any inline-signed message can be modified to return any other data (while still indicating that the signature was valid), and the same is true for signed+encrypted messages if the attacker can obtain a valid signature and encrypt a new message (of the attacker's choice) together with that signature. The issue has been patched in versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1. Some workarounds are available. When verifying inline-signed messages, extract the message and signature(s) from the message returned by `openpgp.readMessage`, and verify the(/each) signature as a detached signature by passing the signature and a new message containing only the data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.  When decrypting and verifying signed+encrypted messages, decrypt and verify the message in two steps, by first calling `openpgp.decrypt` without `verificationKeys`, and then passing the returned signature(s) and a new message containing the decrypted data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.",

    "description": "XWiki is a generic wiki platform. In XWiki 16.10.0, required rights were introduced as a way to limit which rights a document can have. Part of the security model of required rights is that a user who doesn't have a right also cannot define that right as required right. That way, users who are editing documents on which required rights are enforced can be sure that they're not giving a right to a script or object that it didn't have before. A bug in the implementation of the enforcement of this rule means that in fact, it was possible for any user with edit right on a document to set programming right as required right. If then a user with programming right edited that document, the content of that document would gain programming right, allowing remote code execution. This thereby defeats most of the security benefits of required rights. As XWiki still performs the required rights analysis when a user edits a page even when required rights are enforced, the user with programming right would still be warned about the dangerous content unless the attacker managed to bypass this check. Note also that none of the affected versions include a UI for enabling the enforcing of required rights so it seems unlikely that anybody relied on them for security in the affected versions. As this vulnerability provides no additional attack surface unless all documents in the wiki enforce required rights, we consider the impact of this attack to be low even though gaining programming right could have a high impact.

    "description": "Improper Access Control vulnerability in Apache Commons.\n\n\n\nA special BeanIntrospector class was added in version 1.9.2. This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum\u2019s class loader via the \u201cdeclaredClass\u201d property available on all Java \u201cenum\u201d objects. Accessing the enum\u2019s \u201cdeclaredClass\u201d allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code. The same issue exists with PropertyUtilsBean.getNestedProperty().\nStarting in versions 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 a special BeanIntrospector suppresses the \u201cdeclaredClass\u201d property. Note that this new BeanIntrospector is enabled by default, but you can disable it to regain the old behavior; see section 2.5 of the user's guide and the unit tests.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Commons BeanUtils 1.x before 1.11.0, and 2.x before 2.0.0-M2.Users of the artifact commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils\n\n 1.x are recommended to upgrade to version 1.11.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n\nUsers of the artifact org.apache.commons:commons-beanutils2\n\n 2.x are recommended to upgrade to version 2.0.0-M2, which fixes the issue.",

This link, containing a secret code, is then emailed to the user. If an attacker can manipulate these headers (e.g., via host header injection), they could cause ZITADEL to generate a password reset link pointing to a malicious domain controlled by the attacker. If the user clicks this manipulated link in the email, the secret reset code embedded in the URL can be captured by the attacker. This captured code could then be used to reset the user's password and gain unauthorized access to their account. This specific attack vector is mitigated for accounts that have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or Passwordless authentication enabled.
